great
i dont recall you ever telling me what you do at your job
and you probably can't be persuaded to tell me now.
due to your persistant funkitude
"umm, he sits around on irc all day ;)"
funkitude?
"inspect fire alarms, security systems, etc."
booooooring
but it is paying my bills for now
the company was Simplex Time Recirder Company or Simplex for short
Recorder
but they got bought out by Tyco
this big nasty billion dollar corp.
it's paying your bills?  wow
i can work at least half the day and barely pay mine
i pay mine based on ~20hrs/week
break even
who do you work for
?
clients?
me
ok
yeah
yea
well you need more cleunts then dude ;)
clients
right
go get em!
the are now SimplexGrinnell
the compant that I am slaving away for
company
I;m looking to move up to get a programming position :P
sounds good dan
"i bet your fmaily is proud of you, as are we"
hey psu
hi aj
i assume everyone else is actually asleep
and just logging
"not everyone, i hope :)"
but it's been dead in here for the last half hour
I'll give you some good news you can pass onto the others
when they surface
(or they can just read their scroll back as usual)
ok
Zack Brown and myself have been swapping e-mails over 
the weekend and he should have the 
first issue of GNUe Kernel Cousins up this evening
w00t!
:)
(no time zone specified)
should be good ;)
might get some decent coverage for GNUe :)
Not sure of the exact URL
"you've done a good job, organising all this"
but http://kt.zork.net/ should get you there
hopefully
don't see it yet
i vote that derek increase your pay 250%! :)
(from $0 to $0) ;)
the first week's is all IRC
"but next week's will have a real, live mail thread ;-)"
I think/hope Zack's found it interesting too
cool
with me trying to "bend" his KC mail list format
to fit the - erm
less structured
"yay, my python coding is working again"
conventions of IRC
You could write me an auto-summariser...
umm
now *that* would be an impressive bit of AI
hehe
"now now, i'm only a 1st year uni student, i'm only meant to know the basics of java ;)"
i think we's probably have to go fat client for that...
"ok, my python coding is not going too good after all.... ;)"
but it's getting there
time to read the docs ;)
"""always read the instructions, even if you don't follow them"""
hah
this is coding
programmers are lazy
The f1 key is your friend
trust the f1 key
umm
f1 doesn't call up the wxpython help for me :)
"Hey, yesterday's log is 37k"
"yeah, some interesting stuff"
and some random crap ;)
you mean wxpython hasn't "embraced and extended"
the M$ "standard"
big log yesterday
certainly for a Sun
either there's been lots of new development devlopments (err.)
or cw's been trout-slapping again ;-)
hehe
jamest & jcater had a long discussion
k()()l. 
where is GNUe KC?
am I friggin' blind?
"not up yet, will be up later"
"w00t, muh app werks (sorta)"
now to fix up my big screwups :)
you need help
"if you were M$, that would make it ""Release Candidate 1"""
"when i resized the array, i didn't realise i was just appending duplicate references"
so every cell in the array has the same contents
"i gotta make it so an array resize makes new cells, not just new refs to the same cell"
"yes, even java...."
cw - will be reachable later today at http://kt.zork.net/
but give Zack some time to catch some zzz first
bah
he doesn't need sleep
no sleep for the wicked
"i've been about 4 weeks without any caffiene really, i think i can say i'm not addicted ;)"
"but tonight, i need to stay up all night :)"
i am not a natural all-nighter
i can do it without too many problems
last two were General Election 2001 and General Election 1997
"i've done till 5am on 1 cup of coffee, and i went to bed cos i ran out of stuff to do :)"
2001 I actually went to work the next day...
yeah
i've done that
we must be mad
"allnight doing an assignment, then go to lectures the next morning"
"bah, that is like typical for college students"
yep
i don't mind it too much :)
this semester i never started until 11am :)
you won't catch me doing it anymore though now that I have graduated :P
nice
lazy bum :P
I hate night classes though
hated
it is in the early hours of the morning that you become one with the code....
whatever
"with my last employer, "
because the code has infested your mind & is driving you mad ;)
after 2 years 
ajmitch: caffeine & V?  what's "V"?
I had worked every hour of the day 
dtm: an energy drink
except 3 am to 4 am
oh
a;jfwopue
"(excluding air travel, which doesn't really count)"
who let him loose?
dtm: it has warnings not to have more than 4 or 5 cans a day
I once managed 26 chargeable hours in one day
haha
flying Alaska to home
hoped I'd crash the time recoding system
but sadly it can cope with up to 99 hours a day
doh
ajmitch: heh
dtm: it's best to have a couple of cans of V or similar right before an exam - it's impossible to get to sleep in the exam ;)
UK seeems to be getting more relaxed about energy drinks
heh
hey reinhard
used to be all you could get was Lucozade
ouch
(advt. by Lara Croft)
"ajmitch: but you'll probably have to drink before the test, whatever you drank while studying, in order to concentrate and remember :)"
"dtm: well, i don't really drink anything while studying (apart from water, usually)"
dude everytime I would drink mountain dew before an exam I would have to piss like crazy
cw - GIGO
made it hard to concentrate on the exam
hehe
psu: wtf/.
?
"GIGO = garbage in, garbage out"
"or, as they say here, ""you don't buy beer, you rent it."""
heh
:'(
I suck
gotta go now
bye
I will check when GNUe Kernel Cousins is up
& notify the mail lists
also the www.gnue.org front page
TTFN
l8r
ajmitch: Howdy again!
hi
Before I turned in I thought I'd look - and here is the channel.  Woohoo1!
"I have to say, I am getting very interested in this - this enterprise stuff is the key stuff right now, IMHO."
yep
"GNU has the infrastructure, but for corporate interest to really take off, we need to bring them the GNU benefits."
"And this is what is sexy to them, if we get it to work (and why shouldn't we?)"
"And then the web service are just a layer on top of the accounting, HR, CRM, etc."
"sounds fun, eh? ;)"
You betcha!
we're getting the tools together...
"Or, as we used to say in the Marines: oooooooooooRAH!"
"As a professional, I am *sooo* tired of the proprietary stuff."
yes
"Supporting it (trying to). Getting it to do what the company needs (trying to), etc., etc."
So.
ooooooooooooRAH!
hehe
hehehe
"Once these are in place, the FD should really take off, too."
yeah
just a matter of time & lotsa hard work
"Ohhh, yeah."
"But, hey, what else is there to do?"
Stagnate with the old stuff? Yikes!
"And if we don't do it, somebody else will?"
maybe
somebody else won't provide Free tools tho
Probably not.
And if you want something done right . . .
DIY
do it yer bloody self ;)
"where are you, btw?"
Hawaii. You?
New Zealand
A Kiwi! Cool.
"Actually, I'm thinking of taking a vacation - been to W Oz, never NZ tho."
cool
Springtime there?
come down to the south island
"yeah, getting into summer soon"
I've friends who can't say enough good about NZ.
And were Yanks!
we're
:)
it's quite a nice place
especially if you like scenic sorta areas
Oh yeah.
"Hiking, esp."
it's great for that ;)
Lot of open/free software interest in the professional community there?
You at work now?
http://ajmitch.dhis.org/pics/Lake.JPG <- a pic from one of my hiking trips
nope
at home
there is a bit of interest in open/free software
"getting better, but NZ companies still tend to go the MS way"
Same here.
"And Hawaii is *very* conservative in such matters. Drives me bonkers, it does."
NZ companies don't tend to be too bad
"*very* scenic pic, BTW."
"yeah, quite nice :)"
Like a calendar or somethin
that's on one of the tracks down this way
"as you can guess, this part of the country is very popular for hiking, etc ;)"
"My, Oh yes, I can understand that!"
last year i went on a week-long trip to the west coast (very remote area)
only about 50 people use the track i went on a year
was quite fun to get away from it all (went as a school group)
Woohoo!
man I hope some of these small businesses pirating software get whats coming.. for example some are so clueless they don't realize they could use staroffice and be legal
yes
"Actually, Hawaii has some surprisingly good hiking, too."
i'm trying to convince my parents to use openoffice
I bet Rock
staroffice.com is down because of "a power failure has damaged our main host"
my parent's business is not exactly up with licensing (and they only have 2 computers...)
I know several people switching to open/staroffice right now.
only problem is that mum uses MS access quite a bit for simple databases
Common problem.
"Postgres has pgaccess, though."
"man some people in my LUG are funny, we're on IRC comparing electrocution stories ;)"
"i mean nice simple stuff, like with forms, etc :)"
the sorta thing GNUe could be used for
Really?
"Ah yes, the GNU Forms?"
yeah
need a nice graphical DB designer tho for those simple databases
"So, you're doing it to help mom too, then? hehe"
i guess ;)
she uses some proprietary windows accounting software tho
"And why not? Good a reason as any, better than some."
dunno how well wine would run it :)
Doesn't wine require MS Windws licences?
nope
"OS, I mean."
vmware or win4lin does
but wine has it's own implementation of most of the win32 dlls
"Thats right, remeber now."
since Wine Is Not an Emulator :)
hehe
"mum knows that linux mandrake is on her computer, i've shown her how to login & use it"
another problem is winmodem driver...
WHy is winmodem needed?
that's what they have :)
Oh.
i don't think the windows copy is entirely legal (stupid person that installed it....)
sheesh
yeah...
I like my cable modem.. 200-300KBps
i really need to get them converted :)
thats > than dual T1s
I'm holding out for DSL
Mr_You: i'm on a 33.6k modem :)
I'm on 56K
"DSL might be more reliable than my timewarners network, but when it works its faster than DSL"
"my modem is over 4 years old, still working"
there is only one DSL provider in this country
and apparantly they *suck* at reliability
"Cable *is* faster, downstream only."
I hope I never have to use dialup again.. I hope at some point I'm using 3G cell service as dialup replacement ;-)
i don't think NZ has the population density for cable to be cheap
"ajmitch: Covad sucks, they schedule maint. at 9am til 11am"
They all do that
not all
dunedin (where i currently live) is meant to be about the 4th largest city in the world in terms of land area (dunno how)
but only has 110K people ;)
any smartly ran ISP knows to do work in the early hours to not have to deal with support calls heh
at least they should
I'm creating a mirror wooding for myself.. 
wooding?
Mr_You: U a Kiwi 2?
RockTiger: so are you gonna come over to NZ for a holiday? ;)
"Very possible, ajmitch."
Very.
nah
a hawaiian?
"tell me when, i've got a 3 & 1/2 month break starting on sunday ;)"
what is kiwi?
Mr_You: think of andrewm...
besides a fruit
a kiwi is a bird ;)
"Mr_You: naw, 'haole' (white guy/foreigner)"
3.5 months?
its 3:30am don't work my brain
"we call the fruit a kiwifruit, the national bird is a kiwi"
RockTiger: yep
"East coast, Mr_You?"
summer holiday for university
or Kiwi == new zealand citizen
"ajmitch: If i vacation, would probably be in that time frame. I'll keep you posted."
RockTiger: ok
Thanks.
"And, now, I'm off to the pub for a nightcap!"
yeah
night
hehe
night
"Nite, all. Nice talkin' at ya."
"umm.. I must be dumb, cause I can't find woody cvs root"
http://www.vnz.co.nz/photos/specials/javadoubt.shtml <-- i like that effect ;)
yeah me too
"man I need some cold medicine again uggh, "
night
night
good day
morning jamest
you seem to make a forms & friends release?
getting ready to
going to push 0.1.0 out the door
you really wanna push them out the door?
it's cold outside now
;)
hey jamest
hey chillywilly
hey hey
you at work or what?
yes
kewl
using putty to irc from ash
i'm just getting stuff working finally in python ;)
"ah, ok"
like what i was doing in balclutha
I guess so
damn some bugs are annoying at this time of the morning
reinhard: i will try and work on the geas driver some today for inclusion
reinhard: but there's lots to do there
reinhard: so I kinda figure geas driver will be part of 0.1.1 of gnue-common
especially if we come across issues
but isn't it BugFree(TM)?
"yes, but I think NZ'r have a different definition of BugFree(TM) than the rest of us :)"
hehe
jamest: please remember that the api is still subject to discussion betwen the two of us
"if it compiles/runs, it's bugfree, no?"
"reinhard: yip, I understand"
you guys want to read something funny
ajmitch: it is really bugfree AFAICT
reinhard: wow
reinhard: how many LOC?
BUT
gnue/gnuef/samples/history/first.gfd
there are other things that make a code bad than bugs
poor design?
read that file and look at the date of derek's comment and what he was getting ready to package
rofl
haha
i think we missed our target date
by a few days
"hmm, nearly 3am"
i wonder if i shoudl start on the caffiene
why did you stop on it?
stopped a few weeks back
actually i had a couple of cans of this energy drink tonight
"ajmitch: on what can make code bad (or good), you could read http://freesoftware.fsf.org/download/style-guide/style-guide.html#Introduction"
reinhard: ahhh...
does that apply to python? ;)
jamest: wxpython is useful
;)
wxpython is evil too
how so?
lots of oddities
yep
docs aren't *too* bad
ajmitch: it basically applies to every language
even logo
;)
although the style discussion mailing list still hasn't many subscribers :(
"which needs more work, GEAS or forms/designer, etc?"
GEAS
:)
ok
although this is not 100% true
"minaly C coding, right?"
as we are looking at sharing larger portions of code than we did before
ok
so probably you can't distinct that much from now on
yes C coding
there is opportunity for someone like me to help out?
lots
first of all you would want to understand the basic structure
yep
then you would pick a part of the code where you are not satisfied
(i promise there will be such parts)
hehe
and improve it
or you could look at improving portability
i would want to look at being able to use it in a production environment
chillywilly has some ideas of being able to use GNUe stuff along woth DotGNU
production is probably only possible when you don't use the method stuff
RockTigr & I were discussing some of that earlier
"well, if method stuff needs done, then i might have to look at that :)"
unless that's your area?
nope
i'll see what i can do
it's actually what chilly wanted to look at
whether i have time for it or not
ok
although its probably highly complex
and now he has a job...
"i get on well with him, we might be able to work on it together"
maybe we need some coordinator and some simple coding slaves to get the whole system working
:)
hehe
"argh, after 3am, concentration is slipping..."
hey dneighbo
dneighbo: welcome back
hey
"i hope you took the day off, as we need your, um, unique, abilites "
btw: i almost took two really interesting pictures but didnt
was hoping you could test cvs designer and forms
1. 3 goats on pirates of caribbean ride (no flash photography allowed) :(
and
as you can find bugs where they don't exist
2. 1 goat on top of 'thunder mountain' ;)
jamest : i came to work early
dneighbo: how could you?
"so should be home early, then have to pick up car and fix something for hotel company then i am all yours for testing :)"
"btw: psu, the kernel cousins look cool"
what are these kernel cousins
VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED IN Microsoft's free e-mail
and Passport authentication services allowed a
programmer to access credit card information stored on
"the company's servers, forcing it to shut down the"
electronic wallet feature in Passport until it can fix
"the problem, Microsoft confirmed Friday."
now aint that just making people want hailstorm ;)
are kc already up?
yes
gnue kc i mean?
yes
you are now quoted publicly about 'mad goat raping' reinhard 
haha
http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/back-issues.html
and where is the link on www.gnue.org?
;)
reinhard not there yet :(
"woohoo, so GNUe hits the big-time media, eh? ;)"
gnue stuff for kc isnt on the 'main' link for KC
it sems that all the KC issues are covered on linuxtoday.com (which has a big readership)
"oh, ok"
"will be soon, i *hope*"
"argh, i'm mentioned"
what?
jamest: look at the link
"ok, what is this?"
who's doing it?
and how?
psu
by trawling thru IRC logs
it's a weekly summary of the GNUe project
wow
yup
done by hand?
mostly
psu: Thank You
"someone submit this to linuxtoday.com, please :)"
psu: info on the "Non-implemented keywords" thread:
*************************
"neilt and me agreed later to remove the READONLY keyword, too."
btw: guess its time to fix up my irc2html converter
"In fact, PRIVATE, PUBLIC and READONLY are removed meanwhile."
this will help a bit in 'linking' to relevant topics
the changes are commited to cvs.
*************************
also it has key word ability and 'notes' ability
"dneighbo: ooh, ok"
psu: info on the "Andrew Murie's Profiling Code" thread:
*************************
"dneighbo: i'm glad you've got one, psu was thinking about making the logs into html (but wasn't sure)"
In private mail conversation Andrew Murie himself told us he is not happy with that sort of "manual" profiling
and that we would probably do better by removing it
.
So Neil and me agreed to remove it.
This will be done in the next few days.
*************************
over
:)
is andrewm still around?
no
"well, on email, i mean"
i know he's not around GNUe any more (not sure if he's still at treshna)
not at treshna
not in gnue
but aroudn on email
he is
?
I haven't seen any gnue list mail in ages
"i dont know if he is o nthe mail lists, but he gave us his email and told us we could email him with questions."
i dont think anyone has for sometime but theoretically he is still around :)
dneighbo: neilt and me have last week
and he responded
still reachable at andrewm@gnue.org :)
wow
"hmm, 4am, i'm still making progress ;)"
"ajmitch: this is too funny, you are just -12 hours from me :)"
exactly on the other side of the earth
"carefull, neither of you move"
we get imbalanced and we'll start to wobble
argh!
we have been invited to new york for lwce
do we want the booth?
can i go? ;)
dneighbo: I can't make it
btw derek : someone (blanking on who) was willing to do ALS
it's in yesterdays logs
dtm
masta of disasta
"uh oh, chillywilly is here"
"quick, someone grab a trout"
"chillywilly: hah, my python skills are improving, i am making headway (at nearly 4:30am) with this app"
"wrt profiling, I think it would be good to use gprof and rip out andrewm's code"
i just implemented in a few inutes what took me a couple of hours to get right in java :)
"chillywilly: what is wrong with current methods code, btw?"
"gah, you still have not slept since I talked to you?"
nope :)
wrong?
nothing is wrong
I just don't have time to do it
"yeah, how incomplete is the methods code?"
ok
"well i might, especially if i could convince my boss to find a use for GNUe (unlikely) :)"
dude python rocks :)
"it is not really incomplete per se, but it does not work how we want it to work...you can so methods in python and C thanks to neilt, he fixed up the current methods code"
s/so/do
we need a plugin system for various langauges and code to allow you to mix and match at the class level
like what I was talking about before in #freedevelopers
howdy
heya
ok
ajmitch I was thinking like how gst does it's plugin caching...we could do that sorta thing with methods code
hey jcater
"hmm, ok"
"gstreamer uses glib for that, afaik"
"well I'd like to use GObject, it has support for loading types from .so files"
yes
which is the new glib
i know
and since GEAS is alpha anyway we should be ready for production by the time the new glib becomes stable
;)
Gnome 2.0 release or what not
yes
i am just wondering if i will have time to do it :)
i'll find out in the next week or so what i am doing
what you are doing for work?
yeah
k
i need to kill galeon...
"bah, this connection is soooo lagged"
[ajmitch @ ajmitch srct] ps axu |grep java
ajmitch  26947  0.0  3.9 181156 15044 ?      S    Nov01   0:05 java_vm 
the java vm is sooooo leaky ;)
it is a big fatpig
"2.4.13 seems solid, still only using < 100MB swap"
even with that java bloat ;)
well I would expect now that VM is fixed it should be a bit better
chillywilly: you checked out the premeiere of the KC GNUe series?
"dude, when a thread is suspended shouldn't it stop executing right at the spot you suspended it at?"
ajmitch it is up now?
ajmitch: I saw that
it's scary
I don't know if I like being quoted
"chillywilly: yep,  http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/back-issues.html"
they need python bindings to GObject
my name will now live in infamy for the rest of my days.....
"wow, just freed heaps of ram closing galeon..."
(about 90MB)
"hmm, time to get up in a few hours, i'd better get working :)"
how to tell you are a hacker....
".. co-workers say ""wow, you're in already, got up early huh"""
and you are thinking
"... ""hmmm its getting late, i should go to bed soon"""
man I need to go to bed
lol
hehe
but it's not even 5am
hehe
"gah, broken link for the KC"
the "latest" link is b0rked
the archives one works though
yes
dneighbo: I can fly to NY for under $200
time to actually test my code out properly ;)
man I don't like being quoting this much either :P
chillywilly: even *i* was quoted
"ah, bugger"
Segmentation fault
[ajmitch @ ajmitch 0.2] 
hehe
seems that i stressed the wxwindows lib a little
doesn't gtk run in winders?
yeah
but i am using wxpython ;)
far too latelto change it now
hmmmmm
so why do we use wxwindows in forms then?
ask the forms ppl
"cause it gives us GTK, win32, Motif, and MacOS all in one shot"
GTK+ is like the GNU toolkit
someone is more than welcome to write a new GTK specific driver for forms
but GTK runs on those systems
i intend to write a QT one myself once the rewrite is underway
we can force the Gnome ppl to write portable code :P
and I'd rather have a windows app look like a windows app on windows machines
jamest that is just plain evil
yip
well at least you can make it look the way you want it to
i must say that i agree with jamest here
i would maybe even go further
and say we might want a _native_ windows forms client
ugh
isn't that a bit too much code duplication?
there shouldn't be too much intelligence in forms for n-tier
imho
rm-away: lets not forget that forms will always be both n-tier and 2-tier
yes
but there could be other implementations for n-tier clients
that only work for n-tier
and don't have the 2-tier stuff in
jamest once called gnuef a "reference implementation" of a forms clients
"actually, the x-tier stuff is abstracted away from the UI"
so the UI writer knows nothing about the backend
that sounds as if it were intended to have other implementations as well
or shouldn't 
it were?
it was?
hmm... i think it was is correct...
;)
does it matter? ;)
forms is a reference implementation
as I never see it running on things like Palm pilots
and I'm not against people creating clients for win32 platforms written in the language of the week
however I think forms works pretty well
"jamest: but wx and python run on PalmPilots, so why not :)"
they do?
damn
jamest needs a palm pilot for "testing" purposes :)
just reading logs briefly i will go one step further
"having to install cygwin, x, etc to get gtk to 'work' "
is not having gtk 'work' on windows
its have unix work on windows
which is an UNDUE prerequisite IMHO
basically its like saying you should use unix but since you wont we will force you to install it anyhow on top of windows
as to jamest and the qt remark
QT me baby
"would love to see it, but actually would rather see you look at making wxQT"
instead of just adding native qt support to forms
derek: there is a gtk+ port which does *not* require X
so others can enjoy the owrk :)
that's a major project in itself
"i've used the gimp on windows before - just one zip file to download, it ran fine"
much easier to write a gnuef UI wrapper to QT
bbl
jamest : yes easier but not as good for community
dneighbo: you see my comment about tickets?
hi
yes i did
so you willing to go?
I'm considering
i.e. you got 200 for a ticket and a place to stay?
dunno what hotel fees would be
the comfort inn i stayed at in nice part of town was like 69 a night
probably cheaper now
also if you dont mind staying with someone 
i can probably arrange a place for you to stay
via FSF
I don't mind
as usually they make arrangements
as long as they aren't homicidal
i know that a fellow that authors gnue ADA lives down there
and i was to stay with him before but never got a hold of him
he lives elsewhere
if you are considering i will fire off a mail to fsf and see if we can get you a place to shack up at
and i will procure the booth from IDG
where ya'll goin?
perhaps nickr can help you there
as he is in NY
and Mr_You can take the train up one day :)
and stu will stop by :)
and and and
what event is this?
Linux World Expo / NT
"err, NY"
ahh
when?
last week of January
Jan 29-Feb 1 ???
ok
jcater sent mail off to see if we can get you a spot to stay gratis
"if I can get out from under hotel fees, it'd be much more practical for me to go :)"
as $200+food+taxi fees ain't bad
"'course, if wife wants to go, it's $400 + food + hotel + taxi fees :("
+ baby sitting
== more than jcater makes
"is that daily, weekly, monthly, or annually? "
:)
"well, if she wants to go"
"we'd have to fly from Memphis to Austin, TX"
drop off baby at grandparents
then fly from Austin to NY
"man, you have to pay the grandparents to watch them"
bummer
you need to teach your kid to be adorable arround them so they'd watch them for free
nope
he takes after me too much
"well, then I understand"
so  it's $400 + food + hotel + taxi fees + baby sitting ($400 a day)
"man, that's about 5 grand a week!"
so its settled he is going :)
and jamest is paying 
what days is it?
hmm
how "friendly" are friends of the FSF?
they bath (usually)
ello
did ajmitch got to bed yet?
s/got/go
anyone home?
i'm here
good job on the GNUe KC psu 
keeping low profile
:)
double trouble
oh jamest 
ignore my other self
can you install GSL and GNU Common C++ on ash?
do I get to run apt-get under sudo?
"ooh look, someone's trying to bounce mail off my SMTP server"
heh
kick their arse
Mail -> 550 5.1.2 Cannot accept mail for <comeonalready90210@yahoo.com>
heh
that's very interesting
jamest who do I have to kill to get stuff installed on ash?
;P
bbl
hey hey mr mueller
bah
chillywilly kill a trout
to get stuff on ash :)
hehe
bbl
eh?
yet more explosions outside
guy fawkes night
glad I don't have a pet
psullivan: huh?
jamest you live?
"""remember remember the 5th of November,"
gunpowder treason and plot
jamest can you install some stuff on ash?
I see no reason why (something) treason
should ever be forgot"
"in reality, just an excuse for the neighbours to let off some fireworks"
I could go out to one of the public displays
but i'm happier here trying to track down some IRC nicks

off for now - back l8r

"filepuker pro, cool"
ugh
"""Microsoft Deutschland seems to have accidentally pirated itself by shipping the same copy of Windows XP over and over again. Sort of, anyway.

hehe
haha
"dang... hylafax has a job limit of 32,000"
sigh
hmm
where did you get that from (the deutschland)
newsforge
jcater: hmm time to get bayonne a rockin
"jcater: a job limit? whats that? the 32,000 fax is the end of faxing?"
heh
no
it's job numbers only go to 32000
then reset at 1
oh
so I guess that means you can't have more than 32000 concurrent jobs
sigh
what a pity
for some reason I think the limit should be less ;-)))
why?
"I have 10,000 queued right now"
I don't like fax spamming
and have already cycled twice :(
I hate fax spamming more than email spam
me too
"with bayonne, could I configure so that incoming faxes *must* have an extension or is that a PITA for some people on the sending end?"
ie. you must choose an extension before a fax is accepted
hi reinhard
Mr_You yes
sweet
"um, how would that work?"
one thing i am considering doing is setting up at home an anti solicitor service
basically you call me
caller id kicks in 
if you are a 'known' accepted user it rings through
if not it says no solicitors allowed
type in your phone number
and rings through and shows me the number entered
for family/friends i give passcode (4 digit)
so if they arent at phone w/ callerid (that is recognized) they enter a pin and skip right through :)
I've talked with several tech support call centers in which they could only enter 10 digits for a fax number
"cool, you could also add the ""disconnected"" tones to the beginning of the no solicitors message to automagically have their system recognize as a disconnected number"
btw: qwest does some similar things here
but its very expensive
so you might be shooting yourself in the foot if this is more than a "home" number
bayonne is a ONE time '90' digiboard
jcater not really
as if they cant
jcater: yeah that might be a problem
you get their fax number and manually add it to your 'supported' list
"but call centers can have any one of, say, 10 numbers"
that's a PITA
or if thier caller id is disabled
you could 'turn it off'
"i.e. you are expecting a fax and you know they cant get around your deal, you turn on allow all calls"
would be nice if they could offer you random temporary numbers hehe
"I assume Mr_You was talking about an automated, shove it in the closet, type system"
until you get the fax then turn back on
um even so
its unix
you can ssh to a closet :)
sure
yeah that would work
*you* can
hehe
hi dtm
jcater: just make a nice webpage button ;-)
jcater PERSONALLY mine will be controlled via some x10 goodies as well :)
muhahahaha
actually
with bayonne it doesn't matter much anyways cause paper is eliminate
Mr_You well bayonne doesnt do faxing YET
iirc
so technically this would be like a 'fax firewall'
:)
it just blocks and passes through the good stuff
why'd you suggest bayone as a hylafax replacement then? ;-)
but eventually it would be all
because they are working on it :)
bayonne will assimilate?
a 'customer' always helps 'spur' development :)
i plan on using at home for voice
to stop damn telemarketer hell
"actually since paper is eliminated, I could have a public fax bit-bucket that is flushed weekly"
I plan on having IP Phones and auto-forwarding to cell phone
dneighbo: passcodes to talk to you?
hehe
jamest: our passcode is 666 I'm sure :)
you know anyone that thinks hearing your voice is worth the extra effort?  to talk to laurie I could see.  but you?
sounds iffy dude
:)
right now I don't have any phone service cept cell and its great for me.. don't care to talk on the phone a lot
its a PITA when yer ISP puts you on hold for 20 minutes tho
heh.. Todd says we have "quit communicating by email" hehehe
yeah
gnue@gnu.org has become a "spam only" mailing list
heh
lets tell Todd we only communicate via IRC and Bayonne IP phones hehe
no
and in the future GNUe Forms
tell him we only communicate via XML
yeah heh
(please don't mention that in the KC)
:)
but I use GNUe Forms client to make a pretty interface
jamest: no one calls me 
oddly laurie is one that wants it
friend pays like 10 bucks a month for the qwest version and loves it
hi all
hi
"well, there is a cheap version.. just don't answer with call waiting and on your voicemail/answering machine put the disconnect tones at the beginning ;-)"
"might confuse some callers, but they'll get use to it ;-)  and realize its your voice mail when you say your regular greeting"
hello ra3vat
any toying with geas lately?
or did you give up? :)
;)
hello reinhard
neither toying nor give up :)
ok
:)
hi psu
hi aj
damn this house is *really* beginning to get on my nerves.. haven for whatever I'm allergic too
the big news is ...
awaits drum roll...
Kernel Cousin GNUe
is now online
http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/index.html
woohoo!
all hail psu!
bless you
y'all go and check it out
already have :)
(and drive Zack's log files crazy>
I will do a formal announce to gnue-disuss
discuss oops
I'll go ahead and tell you to edit out most of my comments ;-) *snicker*
i'm sure that his server gets hit quite a lot
and also submit an article to the gnue front page
aj - but of course!
psu: maybe you could also post to gnue@gnu.org
reinhard - will do
"psu: what about slashdot, and linuxtoday, and lwn, and all the media?? ;)"
I'll leave that for the moment
ok ;)
"hmm, this could get messy...."
Log message:
	Updated PyPgSQL driver to work on machines other than my own :)
roflmao
hey!
don't laugh
it was a bizzar error
:)
very bizarre
please do submit to lwn and linuxtoday
?
we arent ready for slashdot yet :)
where can I get info on this kernel cousins thing
"jamest : lwn and linuxtoday usually run gnome, dotGNU summaries as well as all the kernel cousins"
kt.linuxtoday.org
i think is official
dneighbo: i guess the only news network we are ready for is segfault.org ;)
rofl
haha
http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/index.html
for those that missed it first time.
<sigh>
psu: my name is "Jack Doe"
hey jbailey
rolf
er rofl
"rolling on laughing floors again, eh?"
heya ajmitch
we told you about that crack laced Mountain Dew
"jcater : were close to mexico, the dope is good here, what can i say"
:)
lwn & linuxtoday duly informed
psu: excellent work
we're probably not ready for slashdot yet...
romla : rolling on my laughing ass would be a good one too :)
leave that for the special 1000th issue...
only 999 to go
dneighbo: wb!
psu: what's the frequency of KC's?
dneighbo: Good trip?
weekly
"psu: Have you got one done?  You said you'd send it for proofing, but I don't think I've seen it."
probably slightly less in practice
jb - Zack has cast an eye over it.
jbailey : very good
night all
psu: I just read your KC.  Good work!
l8r
hi ToyMan 
jcater you around?
or rather will you or jamest be here later? for bug reports?
'sup?
"yeah, we'll be on tonight"
but I can take it now
hey dneighbo
hi again psu
rofl
bbs
hmm
hmm
that was pointless
what was that about?
hi again aj
my conn has been up & down all night
was just going to say that if 
psu: derek said something about having an irc2html program for the logs
"anyone thinks they have been misrepresented on KC,"
I can submit changes.
"err.. not on yours, anyway =)"
psu: was mdean talking about a new release of phpGW?
thanks aj - I will look at the back logs
psu: one thing... mdean's comment about releasing in 4-6 weeks
hi chillywilly
that's for his DCL project
which we are working with
good stuff
"jcater: ah, DCL..."
but you might want to clarify that
ello ajmitchie!
I was deliberately ambigious
ajmitch: you sleep yet?
ah
nothing like IRC for some out of context remarks
chillywilly: don't be silly
ajmitch: go to bed now
"chillywilly: haha, why"
ajmitch: you goof
"it's nearly lunchtime, i'm wide awake"
my experience of allnighters 
and i've got another day to do this python stuff before i have to show it off :)
is that once you've made it thru' 3-4 a.m.
yea I know
"psu: yeah, i've had that"
it doesn't hit you again until the afternoon
psu: i know :)
was taught that about sleep patterns in psychology earlier in the year :)
there are times of the day where you are most likely to feel sleepy
chillywilly: heh
"chillywilly: but you've been working, i've only been coding"
"time for bed, said zebedee"
bye
before I start pulling an all-nighter of my own
heh
g'night psu
hey dudes
forms ppl even
you guys ever check out: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/
looks pretty cool
"yeah I like this too: Another secondary goal is to allow rich multimedia content, such as video and audio, and streaming of it."
bbl
yep
chef?
*********** note to psu (psullivan) **********************
Trying to influence what gets put in?
"(Don't do it, psu!!  Don't succumb to peer pressure!)"
"i go by derek, dneighbo or dnBlahBlah generally im logged in at home and work so usually derek and dneighbo are logged in at same time"

heh
jbailey: and what are you using to bribe psu?
"dead trout, chillywilly seems to leave them lying around, so why not put to good use"
heh
i dunno what his obsession is...
I think the word is "fetish"
lol
I'd hate to see the private-distributed april fools day a "year in review" of the KC. =)
"yeah, it'd be a worry"
there he goes again...
psu: I think we need a weekly trout count
lol
howdy folks
howdy
"lol, i read that as cheifjason"
howdy
chief
jcater: how'd the db driver change work out?
we still have the bad login = crashed app on win32?
oh
I fogot about it
so
I guess it's still broken
lol
unless the CVS fairy fixed it
i can look at it now
ok
I'm not at a Win32 machine anymore
oh crap
i need to get 2.1 python
hmm
chief
wonder if I should load 2.2 alpha instead :)
so I can be like derek
lol
I'd say go for it
except you can't get precompiled drivers for it
argh!
argh?
it's almost too much
to think I spent time making it work with python 2.0
only to find out I can find 2.0 db drivers :)
why are you upgrading to 2.1?
so I can test the db drivers
oh yeah
i have 2.0.1 and I can't find a pygresql or pypgsql binary for win32 python 2.0
son of a 
"i need 2.1 wxpython, datetime, pyxml, etc, etc"
so what else needs done?
um
I dunno
I couldn't figure out the Wizards on Win32
as my setup.py install kept installing an old copy
of TemplateBase
and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from
you must blow away the build dirs
this is a samba share
and manually remove them from the install
and I removed the entire friggin thing
location
ah
I removed everything
edit a file from the dos session
don't save it just edit it
that seems to "fix" a messed up cache
hmm
so there is a samba cache somewhere?
"well, I'm not at a windows machine"
you remember what was happening with wizards?
yes
you would log into the database
it would open a new window with a blank form
and return you to the select database panel
not the table selection panel
ick
hmm
I need plex86 working
rofl
just get your wife a pc for christman
hmm
christmas
jamest: i grabbed new python thinking cool
"well, actually theres a win98 machine within 3 feet of me"
then i end up new pyxml
but then I'd have to set up a samba share
and actually roll over to the other computer
then figure out crap need new wx and new pygres and new date time
only i grabbed the newest python
so i have to compile it all
you wouldn't want me to put myself out that much would you?
but honestly im happy with it :)
jcater: that's part of the new "rollersize" program of weight lost
loss
jcater: you get i would
"jcater: good point, 3 feet has been known to cause serious injuries, definitely not worth risking a career ending injury :)"
if I suffer everyone should
"derek: Damn, I'm living life on the edge.  It's at least 10 feet to other system"
since I have everyone here
was talking to jcater about putting ROADMAP files in each project
0.1.x 
  fix geas driver
  fix foo barulator
0.3.0 
good idea
  add GComm support
been begging for it :)
"etc,etc"
hi pointone
i still want dcl for gnue as well :)
"so we'd have one in form, reports, common, designer, and geas "
"jamest: it was more the configuring samba that I was avoiding, not the 3 feet"
everyone ok with that
jcater: you need debian
apt-get install samba
yip
until we get a secure gnue working on ash
and IIRC a default install is functional
then it will be a gnue app to keep track :)
derek: you have time tonight for gnue?
"derek: Maybe once you have it there, we'll get it on Fencepost ;)"
we need testing
jbailey: now that's funny
and reports will be gneerating the roadmpa file
i think you'll have to wait for our emacs interface and gdbm driver
jamest: It will happen.  You have to admit the generally the current state of database access from the command line just sucks ;)
"er, wait gdbm is too fancy"
"no, emacs interface is probably best ;)"
so funny i forgot to laugh :)O
derek: hi derek
once our agents track down madlocke
and his kneecaps heel enough he can sit in front of a monitor
we'll get to see this new UI stuff he's working on
and a curses client shouldn't be too far off
"jamest: you know, this win98 machine is my wife's"
but the irony is that 
she wants KDE
"cause it has cool games"
:)
hmm
so lets talk gnue-common roadmap while I await downloading
how did we go from a ROADMAP file
to GDBM?
my fault =)
jcater: the funny thing my wife said same thing about gnome :)
loved the games
jcater: basically I was giving fsf foundation hard time
she said ximian gnome sucks cause no cool games
lol
I STILL say the included games greatly contributes to the "user-friendliness"
so she has right ideas even if the wrong reasons :)p
as if it isn't written in emacs or painted on the walls of the cave in the blood of today's kill
it's too new or something
jamest: gnue-common roadmap
trigger architecture
jamest: if its 'usable' w/o 6 months of training its bad :)
0.1.x
  finish GEAS driver
  finish "
  finish "conditional"
  finish "conditional" support
(sorry)
we want this in ROADMAP or TODO
  basic GComm support
"um, I dunno"
we discussed even odds
"kewl, i was hoping someone would volunteer to finish geas"
are we doing that or no?
0.3.0
0.5.0
1.0.0
1.1.0 = devel
1.2.0 = stable
no need for a "stable" pre 1.0 imho
ok
you sure
no
but I don't want to get bogged down in details
if so we need to do one of two things
a. go to 1.0.0 very soon
I'm wanting to put this somewhere so we can focus on whats needed
b. use even odds before 1.0.0
only because some people use this in production (stupid fools)
but barring that detail for now we can say 'next release'
and 'release after that' and ignore numbers :)
so we can be productive 
next release
  - outstanding bug fixes
i want major targets for big rev levels
as geas driver is a 0.1.x release
'release after that'
then we need to focus on "something"
  - basic GComm 
  - functional geas driver
'release after that release'
  - geas using gcomm
  - basic trigger system
we're bumping everything to 0.1.0 except geas and reports
thats fine
so we can do point releases on a branch for bugs and fleshing out features
and major bumps for new features
im trying to do as you say and be agnostic to numbers :)O
"ah, sorry"
:)
"ok, the gnue-common TODO"
at the bottom of the file
0.1.x
  finish GEAS driver
 
0.3.0
 
?.?.?
   finish "conditional" support
   basic gcomm support
   trigger system
   gsetup system
anything else
   world peace
added
Common
  - GComm
  - Trigger System
  - Security System
  - Conditional Support
  - Setup Tool
  - Update Tool
Reports
  - Use GComm (i.e. make server)
  - Create standard for output
  - Start transformation sheets
Forms
  - Lookup Widget
  - Menuing System / blah
  - Security System
GEAS
  - Use GComm
  - Use Forms DB Drivers
  - Security System
  - Use Shared Triggers
is my quick list
give me time and i can pile on more
mind you im not tying these to any particular release
just saying things that we have discussed in past
"by security system all the parts need it, so im assuming will go in common somehow and each piece can implement"
by security i assume some sort of RBAC or the likes
You need to add Trigger Support in Reports
shared or both?
"well, common will distinguish between shared or local"
or i suppose if done right it will all be same
so reports just needs to implement common
correct :)
's triggers
Trigger support (common)
added to all pieces :)
hey derek
Common
  - GComm
  - Trigger System
  - Security System
  - Conditional Support
  - Setup Tool

Integrator
  - Design :)
"im sure missing lots here, but high level these are things im remembering, sure once i start testing in a few minutes the list will grow exponentially :) (poor fools)"
ah crap
derek hang on
gack!
is the GEAS todo up to date?
jamest: have no idea
they already have a roadmap in there
:)
oh boy i have an incredible find
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0880290714/103-2688367-2060605
yes the geas todo is up to date
derek: I found one for you... "Diseases of the Goat"
... just so you can be prepared
derek: rofl
... 'cause you never know
"ok, commiting new TODOs"
now
in forms
the #1 with a bullet major thing IMHO is the UI rewrite
well
so much crap is dependent upon a new UI system
you are gonna implement W3C XForms?
standardized trigger support is up there too
right ;)
crap
forgot about ui rewrite :)
fear the day we get dcl cooking on ash :)
"jcater: ok, so that means we should choose 1 and make it the target of 0.3.0"
the real masta will come out again :)
<sigh>
and make the other the target of 0.5.0
call me a bastard but you guys wanted the roadmap
"yeah, I know"
and maps usuall mean point a to point b :)
plus I don't want major changes all over the place
sure you do!
as if we make fixes on a 0.1.x branch and merge back into cvs
it's more fun that way?!?! :)
can someone download the sgmltools source and email to me?????
so which is a bigger issue for people UI rewrite or triggers?
that's a toughie
or do we honestly have the humanpower to put both into 0.3.0
what does a UI rewrite involve?
btw derek
why are you gonna do that?
check out the history samples in gnuef
first.gfd
and read your comment
"chillywilly: the UI system needs lots of work, we've outgrown what we have"
mdean-[SamuraiJack]: hehe
that cartoon brox
"er, rox even"
"evil takes many forms, most of them look vaguely like the masta"
waht was my comment
only w/ less hair
wife did shave my back this weekend
"On 11.07.00 while getting ready to package 0.1.0, cleaned this sample and am just amazed as it was our first ever .gfd sample back in 07.00.  Ah what memories.  It looks quite different now and its a simple form. :)"
masta == goat herder
I'm starting to sweat making a 11.07.01 release date :)
"damn, did I scare off people"
also what we do in forms impacts the release focus for common
a year old :)
which impacts reports
bwahahaahahahahahah
hmm
what a release cycle :)
you have that backwards
what I do in reports affects common
"the fools, they ask for roadmaps"
which impacts forms
they get roadmaps
"hence, the db rewrite :)"
jcater: of course
like a huge circle jerk of python pain
doesn't common impact everything
hence it is called "common"
"circle jerking with a python could be painful, ill let you let me know :)"
eeeew
but I'm hoping that going to 0.1.0 means we can improve the paritial implemented/unused stuff in the 0.1.x releases
yes
going to 0.3.0 means adding major new feature used in a major new release of one of the others
i could really use triggers
but the UI rewrite is huge marketing
"also, to expand on what jamest us saying"
http://www.odmg.org <-- anyone ever look at that?
we should be able to fix common (via the 0.1.x series) and still have it work with forms 0.1.0
"as saying she runs on windows/unix is nothing like saying she runs on windows, unix, native mac, web, palm, and oh yeah a phone"
jamest: true
"jcater: yes, exactly"
"so my needs are triggers, but gnuef needs might be UI"
"and my needs are triggers, but gnuef needs is a UI"
"as I think people would almost get naughty pleasures from running the same form on their win boxen, web site, vt320  terminals"
plus I can make triggers do what I need now :)
we need GDO - GNU Data Objects :P or something
chillywilly: shut up
what do you guys think of GObject?
it's just not "fun"
sure it is
just needs python bindings
wait a second
jcater: why should I shutup?
a few other things that pop to mind
a. omniORB support (this might be part of gcomm) but its necessary to use forms w/ geas on windows
other than images of coders tied to chairs?
b. while i agree marketing wise ui options help
that is part of GComm
the simple fact is we need applications
one usable good solid app will do more than any number of ui options will
im half tempted to say one of the main focuses should be get one or more apps out
we all have some 'internal' stuff
but i mean something useful and distributable
that's for someone else to worry about :)
and let it in many ways help dictate what is next
well in playing with forms in the past and hearing others the few things i have heard had little to do with new UI's
the were mostly
jcater: you don't like the ODMG spec?
a. trigger stuff (both of you state you need them :))
chillywilly: what does that have to do with UI's and triggers?
b. lookup box support (this kills me)
"jcater: nothing, it has to do with db stuff"
duh
b. part of UI rewrite
c. menu system (in sense of multiple forms being called via menus)
c. part of UI rewrite
im not sure of that (c)
dude
im thinking c is going to be part security in some ways
the current UI system hard codes the menus
thinking in skliens lines
"of menuing being processes really, but i suppose its a ui component"
anyhow just thinking outloud
and I don't want to put any time into more UI hacks
trying to remember what pissed me off using forms in the past :)
the answer of course: damn grouchy arrogant bastard developers
hi gulliver2000
"I'm thinking maybe 0.3.0 forms roadmap should be UI rewrite, but 0.3.0 common roadmap should be trigger support"
that would work
hi
then we could fold the changes into forms during the 0.3.0 release cycle
"or, The One.Oh.One"
jamest: that may make more sense
as there's a set amount of stuff to
do to get triggers working (both shared and local)
but
the second part is standardizing on the forms specific language
hmm
that made more sense in my mind than in IRC :)
it did?
I thought the idea was to have a plugin system for various langauges?
chillywilly: it does
that's part of the gnue-common part
i think we're reviving part of the part discussion
??
on how to access things from multiple languages
write a plugin that oads whatever interpreter
based on what type of method
you could have a cache like ld.so.conf
"no, things like ""HOw do i get the current value of the current field named foobar"""
they register them selves as handlers of that lanaguge
etc.
let's stick with the roadmap discussion
yes
but that does bring up a good point
"when you see a method you look into the cache and load the langauge plugin for it, etc...ok I am done"
0.3.0 Implement trigger support (python based)
0.3.x (or 0.5.0) implement more languages into trigger support
'cause python triggers will be the first
yea
"and maybe once they are working, the focus "
shouldn't be on getting as many languages as possible working
but the focus should move on to something else
once the framework is there you can asdd whatever langauges you want
"chillywilly: yeah, but we are discussing priorities here"
I'm saying adding the extra languages may not be the
something else - setup.exe install on windows
top priority
jamest: definitely
should probably be in each roadmap
"jcater: sure I agree, but priority should be to do it correctly to support miltiple langauges so as not to rewrite code that's not cool"
i think it will be important to 'proof' another language when the time comes
but short of proof i dont think it needs to be coddled along until a 'maintainer' for that languages support comes along
implement python first after you have the framework...the rest are secondary
"chillywilly: yes, I think we are in agreement :)"
ok :)
just for clarification triggers == methods == form events?
same code right?
yip
k
samurai jack is cool
"ok, we haven't talked about designer"
or reports
well
there's no hissing in GNUe
"quick stick a cork in him , our blow up coder is leaking"
part of the forms UI rewrite is a restructuring of designer
jamest: rofl
or at least following the UI rewrite
designer needs to be more generalized
"so it can handle things like reports definitions, etc"
it needs a better "debug/run form" system
i'd like to see it do more introspection of data source
s
yes
that can be 0.3.0
so we could tree out a data source 
and drag into 
because the base structure is being ironed out in common
"i.e., the basic introspection"
yip
I'm afraid to touch the GEAS TODO
it reads like a book
that hurts jamest
:'(
"no, i mean it's that good a TODO"
oooh
our todo's look like crap in comparison
 thoguht you wmna t we sicked in that our TODO is HUGE
example
"er, meant"
Planned for 0.2.0:    
5.  method handling should be redesigned {methods}
5a. Bug - If methods have non-string arguments the parser fails.
"    (segfault with no debug, hits assert in debug version) {classdef}"
5b. code from the methods subdirectory may not depend on orbit-idl generated
"    files, or these generated files need to be put into another subdirectory"
I think our GEAS masta whipped it into shape
compared to forms
(reinhard)
0.3.0
  UI Rewrite
:)
hehe
"ok, I'm commiting what we talked about"
derek: you here?
did you guys sschedule to have ameeting now or did this sorta happen?
chillywilly: schedule?
wtf is that?
it sorta happened
maybe we should make it so we have once a week
make everyone show up
:D
muuwahahhhaa
masta has gotten to me
im here sorry responding to boat loads of email :(
putting kids to bed
no problem
and listening to a screaming child (sigh) 
damn kids!
"derek: so, you are saying you need something to do?"
"man, you'd think they'd leave you alone since you're testing cvs for our upcomming release"
jcater: remember that url i sent you on introspection?
for like autocomplete in forms
vaguely
I have it bookmarked somewhere
why?
just asking :)
no reason
"ok, the todos are commited"
please look and gripe
:)
jamest: dammit
L(
:)
ok
"well, it's a start"
I just commited so we could talk w/ same ref
"well, in common 0.1.x:"
  finish introspection support in individual dbdrivers
"(currently, postgres (and maybe oracle) have introspection support"
how does a db do introspection?
sounds good
what does that mean?
chillywilly: table names; column names for tables
basic schema lookups
i though connections.conf provided a sample file?
"ah, nevermind"
:)
did you add it?
no
you wanna me to?
yip
ok
hmm
record locking?
"mdean: hello, shot you more mail"
im needing some dcl loving soon expect gnue evil on dcl soon
derek: everyone needs some good lovin'
jcater: via select for update in the db drivers?
jcater: or something more complex
we also need to finialize where we want this stuff to install
and I think it should be part of a major version change
in hand with gsetup?
jamest: I'd think that'd be left up to the particular driver
as I know Oracle can do a select for update
"and, yes, I agree that's a major version change"
what about cross-db transaction support
or is that a whole new service
"(that's way down the line, btw :)"
hmmmm
why does it seem like you wanna implement GEAS in your stuff :P?
"chillywilly: um, we are about ""taking what you need and leave the rest"". I don't think this is iimplementing GEAS in our stuff"
and it was just a question
chillywilly: geas doesn't do cross-db transaction support and we're working on all roadmaps not just a single one
chillywilly: I take it your stance is that should be part of GEAS
wel it is supposed to handle transactions....then again nevermind
"well no, it can be part of a common db abstraction thing"
"chillywilly: i don't think it works now, and i don't think geas supports more than a single db compiled in at a time"
"well, we're all entitled to do that occasionally"
jamest: well we know it is a hack
"btw, what about security...you guys still looking/thinking about RBAC?"
Roel Based Access Control
"er, Role"
definitely
just not sure how that fits in yet :)
me neither
gotta actualy read some more of those papers and think about it
i think the point is that db abstraction etc (transactions)
shoudl be in common
so that geas and 2 tier can 'share'
the idea is to get geas using as much of common as possible
yes I agree
arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
kids misbehavin tonight
cant get crap done
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
"thing is do you go with relational db abatrction or do we (GEAS and/or GNUe) go with ODMG and OO stuff like OQL, OIF, etc."
them again there's probably atill an underlying relation mapping there
are we still on the roadmap?
or in the details :)
more like roadkill
bah you know me I just go on and on
I can't help myself
with this product will a user have the potential to have many windows open at one time to get all the info they need?
derek: in case you remember i am dn or drahc
argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
win32 support is down again
um
what changed?
"my python, wxpython, pyxml, etc"
with same code base
pointone: what do you mean by windows?
the forms client can be open as many times as you like
but it doesn't do something like MDI
and you can have forms launch other forms
it does support multiple "pages" if your data doesn't fit on one screen
"but even then, only one page can be visible at once"
jcater: connectoin manager is None
argh!!!
you running designer or forms?
wait
missing connections.conf file
will there be a parent frame that all others reside in or will they all be there own window on graphical systems.
all on their own windows
hmm
pointone: but we do support "
i _think_ it wouldn't take too much effort to make this MDI
"tabbed" views
at least in the GUI versions
tabbed views...
pointone: let me find screenshot
do other software of this type use multiple screens or do they somehow consolidate the info into an easier to navigate system
ive seen shots of forms and designer
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-My_eGallery&file=index&do=showpic&pid=14
is a tabbed view
we've talked about a consolidation system
"pointone: well, for a single task, most software of this type keeps things in a single window"
but we've not started such a system
"right, im just wondering if there is a better way."
but multiple "tasks" could of course be multiple forms instances
maybe I don't understand what you
are asking
multiple tasks?
"well, say maintaining an account is one task, while entering new contact information is another task"
"the account maintenance would be one form (hence, one window)"
"ive not been involved in creating this type of software, but..."
pointone: hello i do recall the name drahc believe it or not :)
"i would have thought that the way someone interacts with the system, the simplicity of someone to find the window with the info they wanted to go back to"
would be a part of the more basic system.
derek: hi
hmm
"well, we are a framework"
this is what sklein was working on
yes
derek: just listening in on your design talks
IIRC he based it upon gnuef code
but we never saw it :(
in any case this wouldn't be hard to add
jamest: a frame work
i think what you are discussing is what i had listed as
'menuing'
a <category> in each form
in the 'roadmap'
and an app that displays available forms
derek: im thinking more of a whole design
or one enforced by filesystem heiranrch
historically curses based systems did this all via menus and i think most gui apps continued this tradition (the ones ive used)
so you have
say
accounting 
not like the window menu of say word on mswin
  - add account
bad example
accounting
  - create invoice
jcater: he's talk Sql*Menu IIRC :)
  - accept payment or such
where the top level menus were 'modules' so to speak
and the detail menus were 'processes'
of course this is how 'security was enforced' as well
either you had access to a menu option or you didnt
etc
my opinion is that if you want to build a gui system you go beyond an curses look
not saying its the 'best' way
jcater: you check in the import updates?
just stating when i say 'menuing' i mean a similar 'effect'
as now I'm getting a can't find pypgsql driver on startup
doesnt have to be limited to just menus
it could be tabs
I'm sure I did
or something else
"pointone: by the way, we are trying to be UI independent"
jcater: ui independent?
"we plan to support curses, html, as well as the traditional GUIs (like gnome, kde, etc)"
pointone: are target is any interface via the same data entry form definition
are = our
derek: 
we're even talking about a phone interface via bayonne
oops
so that a system run on html forms or one with a kde interface can talk to the same system?
"not only talk to the same system, but run from the same code base and same design"
"yes, the core code is the same"
the UI is created via drivers
we used to have a curses interface working w/ our GUI driver
does that allow for more flexibility or less in the overall design?
"basically, you create a form layout definition and that single definition can be displayed/run via any of the supported UI (curses, gnome, html)"
most important part being an xml form desriptions which can be implemented on everything
"er, anything"
pointone: less if you're after a windows app
pointone: more if you're wanting to do data entry
"with one gfd file you can support your windows, macintosh, unix, and web users"
running the same code base
and possibly palm-pilot :)
"you can also have a call center full of old vt terminals (text only, amber screen)"
that can use the same form as your windows user
but of course your windows users would have the benefit of a complete GUI
"i.e., it takes advantage of the underlying interface as much as possible"
"but, we're made some tradeoffs in some peoples eyes "
so do you think most business that will use gnue will use terminal of gui?
both actually
I have a nice home system
but it'd be real nice to be able to ssh into the gnuenterprise.org server and run a form over telnet
to run a gui system at home I could do 
gfclient form.gfd
or at work 
then when I telnet into the sytem from home
and type 
gfclient form.gfd
the system falls back to text mode
i can also store my forms on a web server
and do 
gfclient http://www.foocorp.com/form.gfd
from my laptop on the road
"jamest: yes, that import update was committed"
and have it access the same form my people at the main office are using
jcater: she's dead jim
"er, jason"
:)
pointone: you'd be surprised how many business user still have Wyse 50's or DEC's
and they make perfect sense
jcater: i forgot mxdatetime install :(
ah
need to add that to the setup.py :)
yes
"actually, we need to write a free replacement to those darn mx.* tools"
:)
so you send data and ui info over the pipe?
pointone: depends
but typically no
just data
take a saleman on the road...
  they can have gnuef client installed on laptop and pull form definition from web server
    then all UI is local and only data is transmitted
so they download the ui info once and then data transmits from there on out
"  they can have nothing on their laptop, but ssh into the main system and run it text based which means the text ui is going over the wire and the app is running at the office"
  they can have nothing on their laptop and access the form via a web brower
  they can not have a laptop and pick up the phone and access the bayonne interface to get some data
how does one know what forms are available for them to use?
"well, you could put them all as links on a web site"
on unix systems you can create symlinks to the client as each form name and the users learn them as "commands"
icons on the desktop
hmmm
we don't (yet) have a tool that pulls it all together into a navigator type system
but you could make a web page do that now
but this is something you are going to do?
w/o too much effort
"i believe so, i know i could use it today"
as I have to give my users commands or icons
and it's a pain
jcater: help!
import PgSQL 
fails on win32
cool: debian added plex86 package
jamest: how so?
unless I'm in the c:\python21\PySQL directory
it can't find the module
(now if I only had debian)
PySQL directory?????
I didn't have a PySQL directory at work
jcater: i tried in SF to convert you to the side of light and goodness :)
er
unless I'm in the c:\python21\pyPgSQL directory
running 2.0
pyPgSql 2.0 w/ python 2.1
um
that means they changed the import statement
pointone: also
when geas gets going good
i think you'll be able to do off line updates
so salesperson could get a snapshot of the data on their laptop
hi ppl
edit it without connection to network
you probably need to change the pypgsql import to:
try:
  import PgSQL
except ImportError:
  from pyPgSQL import PgSQL
and when plugged in again it'll sync the data
StormBringer: howdy
I remember your nicj
nick
how's it going?
StormBringer: hi
jcater: it may be better ;)
jcater: I'm going to flip that
so that the from is first
ok
as this is the release yesterday 2.0
jamest: what size business would you target gnue towards?
pointone: we have to grow
so initially small to medium businesses
eventually I think we'll be able to handle rather large systems
Changes since pyPgSQL Version 1.6
=================================
pyPgSQL is now a 'real' python package (i.e. there is a directory named
pyPgSQL that contains a file named __init__.py).  PgSQL and libpq are now
modules contained in the pyPgSQL package.
are all users going to have to be computer literate individuals?
jamest: so that is the case
pointone: no
pointone: but they have to be trainable
pointone: they probably do need to be literate
jcater: i think you can get forms that'll hide most of the "computer" stuff from the user
jcater: they just enter the data and press "save" once in a while
even that could be done in a trigger
eventually
so the monkey on the phone could fill in the blanks until the last field is reached 
enter a y in a field labeled "Save Y/N"
i think we will be monkey compatiable
for most modules
as I have some users that are not good with machines but seem to grasp gnuef 
"man, I have to get up in about 5 hours to head out of town"
out of town?
users revolting that bad eh
"yeah, family member having minor surgery"
"I said literate, not computer literate :)"
wanted us to be there
but it's at 7:30 am and 3 hour drive
and I hate not sleeping at home
even if I don't do much of it
"sleeping" that is
rofl
"says ""sorry we arent ready for your torture testing yet, please try back in a few days"""
is this a common cvs message?
"jamest: thanks for all you conversation, i was just looking for more insight into gnue and its mission, by the way, if you had a mission statement what do you think it would be?"
derek: for da masta yes
:P
gnuebot: its whats for dinner
er GNUe its whats for dinner
haha!
it is?
"mission statement, to boldly go where no gnu has gone before"
"Please.  Make it stop."
"hmm, i was wondering what i was gonna have tonight..."
GNUe it's GNU for Business
pointone: I have no idea
gnuebot: putting the Free back into Free Enterprise
jamest: roflmao
"err, GNue putting the Free back into Free Enterprise"
i politically incorrect one would read something to the effect
what are the cons of systems that you are trying to correct with gnue?
heheh
that reminds me
"pointone: they are tied into proprietary systems... we work with MANY, MANY systems"
"Stop letting overpriced consultants sell you overpriced solutions that require overpriced customizations"
we have this cool radio show witht hese 2 guys Bob and Brian
thye had a little commercial like that
"pointone: Well.  Since the people who hang out here will be the only ones who understand GNUe, I think we're all hoping it'll be a nice big cash cow =)"
We're all for consultants
jamest: something like that :)
"I hear stupid ppl"
"e.g., Oracle has a similar Forms product"
as some of us do that for a living
but
but it only works with Oracle :)
Pleas. Make Bob and Brian Stop."
we're trying to keep them honest
it is hilarious
"keep them honest, or take their money.  Whatever comes first ;)"
if you don't like your current gnue consultant you can find another one
(Don't mind me.  I'm not actually a GNUe hacker..  <grin>)
"jbailey: how about 'honestly, take their money'"
derek: naw.  I'll take their money anyway I can.
Honest!
if you don't like the way gnue works you can change it and in doing so NOT buy me a new BMW
sssssh
you're gonna spoil it damn you
quite a heavy thing to put on the user.
too bad not everyone likes to code though
it's not on the user
pointone: this is true for al Free Software
s/al/all
the idea is that if you don't like your consultant
an example
nautilus
uh oh
"(s)he doesn't own the code, or the regional rights to the code"
that projects 'company' went out of business
"but the 'customer' wasnt left holding the bag, the product lives on w/o the company"
anyone code savy can tweak the system
so a company would hire a gnue consult and have them create a system for their business?
we'll provide a basic system
"we offer this advantage, but a similar bent is if the company which provides 'gnue' to you pisses you off you can go find another"
"that's extendable via packages(modules, thingies)"
pointone: they COULD do that
they can hire me if they want to :P
chillywilly: you?
you can think of these as plug-ins for your web browser
I won't say no
or they could just use the base system 
or they could use it internally
so if a tech savy user wants a new modules they can plug it in
we plan to offer packages/modules that are like 'shrink wrap'
if you want something more you have to have someone make it
so someone can walk up and use out of box
in our experience we find FEW companies work this way
derek: right
eventually we'll have a clearing house of packages
they have 'little quirks' on how they want things
or they want it integrated elsewhere etc
so it is just a nice base for us :P
that is where the 'consultant' role comes in
or tech support
so you can just grab something close someone else has made and tweak it to your liking
or training etc
"hehe, that's how I came to be here... I was implementing GNUe at my office and decided to ""tweak"" it"
jcater: and what are you all using in gnue in your office?
jcater: now you are a GNUe code slave
:P
and once we had the internal gps tracker and shock collar on jcater he kinda gave up the fight and has been coding ever sense
jcater: and then you got sucked into the pit that is GNUe.....
"pointone: well, right now we are using it at our call center"
"crap, cvs passed my first test, first time"
I blame it on drugs
how much of a business processes would you like to have covered?
no no
atmospheric crack levels
chillywilly: See what happens when you give those up?
that's the ticket
pointone: not sure I understand what you are asking
jcater: i see all the functionality that will be implemented in gnue
"the accounting, customer relation, forecasting, etc..."
how much talks to each other?
how much is real time
the idea is they will be as integrated as possible
yet be able to be used independently
"with a gnue system, what other apps will a business still have to purchase? "
gack
my gauntlet form isnt breaking it
"(i.e., if you only need the supply chain, it will work by itself)"
BUT
"if you have supply chain AND accounting, they will work together in real-time"
um we hope to be like a sap
hopefully you wont have to 'purchase' anything :)
would a company only need supply chain?
"other than hardware, consultants, support :)"
"pointone: well, it depends"
take my case
we have an accounting system in place already
and no desire to change
(as that's a BIG deal)
BUT
we have no supply chain management
"so in that case, we could use GNUe"
we are working on another product
is yours a small business?
yes
it is
"goood work at keeping da masta at bay jamest, jcater :)"
his gauntlet form is no match for your hackery
chillywilly: who is da masta?
the forms?
masta = derek
"see he's got this mean, sick, twisted nature"
so we made him management
ahh
"pointone: also, I don't know if we got the point across that we are really two projects in one: 1) A complete architecture for implementing business apps and 2) a set of packages that implement business apps"
:)
the reason I said that is we are not restricted to creating business process apps
the framework and an implementation of the framework?
no
otay its busted
our framework could be used in dotGNU right ;)?
heheh
the framework and applications that use the framework
derek: where?
that would make da masta happy
the reason I said that is
derek: triggers in samples
may not work
"someone could do an educational management system using our architecture (rather easily, as a matter of fact), but this may not be a ""business process"" so to speak"
if it pulls from an old datasource
if that makes any sense
well i have four buttons
ok
"a next record, previous record, insert, delete"
"the next, previous seem to work"
the insert delete 'appear' to work but dont
dont know if its NOT saving the data
if they are based upon old data drivers they will not work
or if its just not binding to correct id number
as that is major different
derek: got a joke for you: 
"a man went to the doctor and said, ""doctor, my leg hurts when I do this."" and the doctor says, ""well, don't do that"""
and we figured we'd rather work on getting real trigger support in gnuef
  <trigger type="NAMED" name="phoneNew">
blckPhone.helper.object.newRecord()
</trigger>
than kludge new examples together
is the trigger
derek: i don't think that'd work anymore
  <trigger type="NAMED" name="phonePrev">
blckPhone.helper.object.prevRecord()
</trigger>
does seem to work
but not the newRecord()
"well it might work, perhaps just the save is toast"
let me look see
"jamest: hmm, i guess i just cant picture how gnue is making things better than the proprietary systems yet, other than they are not proprietary and someone can make it whatever they want."
jamest: i agree with you on making sure if the creator company disappears someone should still be able to support it.
um in several ways
pointone: that's a big deal to some friends of mine
proprietary software is evil
they plunked down 5 digits for a solution that was complete crap
evil I tell you
they didn't own the code
jamest: i dont doubt that
Free the software!!!
the code didn't work
the author didn't care
it ended up being cheaper to walk away than sue
jamest: I think that friend was me :)
proprietary software is not evil.
jcater: nope
"uh, yes it is"
pointone: chillywilly is our in house free software fanatic
pointone: you just have to say "Man that KDE is better than buttered toast" once in a while to keep him in line :)
jamest: hes a KDE guy?
"anywho, this is GNU dag nabit"
prop. software is for the birds
"pointone: nope, it's not free enough"
chillywilly: what would the birds do with it?
i just like giving him crap until he slaps me with......
crap on it :)
"dang, chillywilly no trout?"
i think he meant "propeller software is for the birds"
jamest: just admit it the ONLY reason you are using KDe is because it is further along than Gnome not because of freedom issues
"chillywilly: yes, i admit that"
chillywilly: do you think software like soundforge or logic audio or cubase should be open source?
lol   me too
pointone: all publicly distributed software should be Free Software...there are a couple exceptions
jamest: go get some rest!!!!!
however I've got enough hours in gnue to have a little credit on my "non free software" account
like an embedded system
you can't change the code easily in your microwave
:P
chillywilly: hmmm
"jamest: uh, no"
"chillywilly: dude, i've got like 3 or 4 _hours_ in this project"
pointone: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/DevelopersIntroduction/c31.html#AEN36
is a reason why its better than prop software
give or take a few :)
no amoujt of time is enough to use the dark side
hehe
actually the default theme is a little lighter than gnoems
that's more than me :P
kde is not the dark side
im not doubting that money is an issue.
you said non-free dude
or the others either
ok this is more than trigger errors
pointone: its not about money
you boys got bugs
any takers ?
jcater: i know
derek: what dya got?
jamest needs to GO TO BED!
chillywilly: sorry s/non-free/KDE
so does chillywilly
go to /gnue/gnuef/samples/track/forms$ 
er
go to yourcvsdir/gnue/gnuef/samples/track/forms$ 
actually go to
there
sigh
go to yourcvsdir/gnue/gnuef/samples/track/sql$ 
and create the tables if not already created
the go to forms
gnuef doesn't supprt .sql files
and run that form
:)
rofl
jamest: yes it does
there again
just run them through reports to convert them to .gfds ;)
jcater: I didn't get the windows think looked at
dude!!!!
that's a good point!
reports can generate GFDs
mwahahaha
guys: should I be scared?
always
derek: im wondering how long it will take to create something as full as say SAP without the constraints from your non prop document
"be afaid, be very afaraid"
pointone: we've got the time :)
pointone: gnue isn't a rapidly developing project
pointone: but she's too damn stubborn to die
:)
jamest: i see
we won't let he rgo
jamest: jcater either of you get tables setup to test that form/
we love her too much
derek: which form?
"i hope you realize im not criticizing gnue, im meerly inquiring as to what you all think about"
there are lots of dorms in there
contact_manager.gfd
think?
pointone: it's love hate love for me
who does that?
derek!!!!
jamest: you know you wub her
"pointone: good questions, believe me we know what criticism is :)"
your load script connects as dneighbo
that sucks
i just did a pg_dump and checked it in
ah
that was before i knew it did that
derek: ive been thinking of a system for about a year and a half and have pictured something totally different in my mind
we are all ears
the system i have pictured is way different. i dont believe you would like to hear.
wtf: you all kill short options?
not all of them
do a --help
"derek: side note: i have no experience in software design, but i have limited code experience"
-h got killed :)
argh!
it's easy to add back in 
btw - that form won't connect
i ran load.sql and create_all.sql
what else is missing?
um
"derek: just wanted to let you know that im not experienced in this work, but would like to become part of something that changes the way people do business"
none of those SQL files define the HISTORY table
changing meaning the ease not the practices they have
"ah snap, i added that later in life"
jcater: he's toying with us
there is a load_history.sql right?
or did i not check that bastard in

"Man, Barber's Adagio for Strings, Op. 11 is the bomb baby"

derek: you fixing cvs
?
jamest needs to GO TO BED!
ok update -Pd
jcater is right
then run create_history.sql in psql
then try form
btw: seems to be editing data just majorly screwing with where the cursor is after a save
ok the add works as does an edit just fouls w/ cursor
crap
and you fixed the nav bar stuff to play well with detail which really hurts this form :)
actually now i recall it did this before and was asking for a fix on it :)
I think I know how to fix it
cvs delete contact_manager.gfd
and if you still have troubles
call you in the morning :)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=1M
:)
no
that's not secure
either one of you get the form to run?
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/hda bs=1M
yeah
it's running
roflmao
ok
add a record
i.e. enter first name last name
then pick an address type
and type in address info
and save
then do a second record
rm -rf / wqorks great too =)
to hear god
cat /vmlinuz > /dev/audio

i can't even get your data to load w/o tons of errors
cd /; find . -name * -exec rm {} \;

well i think id's are toast in master detail in some fashion or another
chillywilly: forgot the -f on the rm
yea
derek: this all changed in a massive way
 /msg jamest but it is trickier eh? He might buy that one right? l)
;)
derek: how could we justify a major release if we didn't invalidate any existing forms
i believe i had this all working after db rewrite
THOUGH i never FULLY tested so this coudl have been a bug from then
I think it was that mickey mouse guy
he's brian washed you
brain even
nite
it si NOT a small world after all
see you later on tues or weds
did I ever mention how much I hate syncronizing threads?
someone plz shoot me
bang
"see you all tomorrow, should have more testing time then"
jcater see what you can find out on this

hey
man f I catch that fucking cat it is going to die
just to clarify
today i wrote in a mail that i expect incompatible api changes in geas within the next months
this is because i expect jamest and jcater to _request_ api changes
as they write the geas driver for forms/reports
and i expect myself to fulfill those requests
i will _not_ make api changes w/o agreeing with jamest/jcater (as the other side of that interface)
just like i don't make changes to gcd syntax w/o agreeing with neilt (who is the main person on the gcd authoring side)

your site looks nice enough - i notice a lot of tentative 'enterprise' things on sourceforge lately.
tsk tsk - are you all coding?
or something
i am looking at your architecture diagram
i think you could generalize your model by adding an investor interface - that way you could fit many more business models including non-profits
"I don't understand, whats the url that you are looking at?"
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/modules/NS-My_eGallery/gallery/GNUe/GNUePkgArchitecture.png
"well #1, I think this drawing is *very* generalized.. I'm not sure what you mean by investor interface"
theoritically you could customize GNUe to fit any business model
well you have 3 packages - 2 have external interfaces - in a non-profit the other package would also 
you are considering "customer" and "supplier" interfaces?
yes
those are just entities that interact with their respective frontend functions
this drawing is an example of GNUe architecture
I am familier with sybase
"sure, you could create an ""investor"" entity that had specific functionality, just as the ""customer"" and ""supplier"" have been described"
what kind of hardware is necessary for a reasonable experiment?
generally an investor only needs prepared reports AFAIK
gemcat: any pentium w/ 32MB should do I'd say
really? 
"sure, unix/linux OS don't require much resources"
is there a book or tutorial out there?
on what?
the development cycle mainly
nothing on GNUe
I have been studying pb but dont like the licencing
whats pb?
pb is sybase enterprise development environment
ahh
powerbuilder
"oh ok, heard of that"
that and the full features are only available on nt/w2k servers
the pb looks like vb but it does most things right
hehe
database support in vb is not plesent
pb is very good at database - but you end up on a solarus or win2k server
solaris is good 
"well true, but not a regular box either"
nah
without a book it will tke me too long to figure out the package 
well its still in alpha development
"and you can create 2-tier apps, which isn't too complicated"
looks promicing anyway - I think you should pick up all those little odd projects at sourceforge somehow as modules
what projects?
there's a lot of projects on sf that are dead too
there are several new ones in very early stages
"one i looked at was for forums, one for fundraising"
yes - i am prayin for project management so i can escape windows
"dcl.sf.net could be used as a good project manager, mdean is the author of it"
there is also #dcl
I have talked to him at #dcl
I am a P3 jockey for more than a decade
what is P3?
is high end scheduling - i have a 105million project
derek has also created GNUe screens to DCLs database tables
I am impressed - but i am still too ignorent to get much out of it
we use Expedition also - which is high end document control but any enterprise system can do that with not too much programming
well bbl
I will download the gnue and see what it looks like
its dangerous for a planner to have too much time to think
thanks
mornin
morning
hello all
howdy
hiya
'sup chillster?
jcater!
just the man 
heheh
john!
just the man 
lol
'sup?
i was thinking (gasp!)
gnue-common is now being used lots of places
sigh
"how about bumping forms, gnue-common, and designer to 0.1.0"
do you think designer is 0.1.0 quality material?
then I can make a statement like "The 0.1.x releases of common still work w/ gnuef 0.1.0"
ah
what I was wanting/thinking about was the geas driver
works for me
as a gnue-common 0.1.0 could be branched in cvs 
did you say "branch"
did you really just say that?
and patches to the geas driver would make 0.1.[1-9]
which would be merged into head
only patches would be branched
I have no problem w/that
but maybe we should go buy a CVS handbook
:)
as the other way was a fscking nightmare
you usually keep stable releases on a branch
chillywilly: right
that branch would be patches only (the geas driver exists but doesn't work)
so we can release a gnue-common 0.1.1 with functional geas driver
and not require a gnuef 0.1.1 and designer 0.1.1 release
right now they are a package deal
sounds good to me
jamest: did you get me message about updating the graphics (from the log yesterday?)
working on it now neilt
"cool, no urgancy"
just wanted to make sure its in works
jamest:  thanks
no prob
but I may need some help
sure
anyone out here have easy access to DB's other than Postgres/MySQL?
(that they actually know how to use :)
I can get Oracle but i loathe setting it up
"well, that's the one I have access to :)"
I'd like to get some others testing the new gnue-common drivers
:)
I have a few installations here at home
but like I don't know how to do the equiv of sqlplus or mysql or psql from the command prompt
:(
"'course, I guess I could RTFM for them"
neilt: are these new pics
?
whats the question
should I just replace the pics
yes
and leave votes and comments as they are?
yes
is the GEAS pic new?
nope
it has been update
updated
i am getting ready to leave
"so if you need help, now is the time"
ok
i'm just about to switch the forms one
forms pic updated
does it look correct?
wait
wtf?
looking
"yep, forms one is ok"
you didn't need forms pic updated did you
nope :)
but it is still ok
that is good
the GNUePkgArchitecture.png is updated
I can't find GNUeGEASArchitecture.png in the gallery
GNUePkgArchitecture.png is ok
its the only other one in the gnue area
"ok, the filename used to be GNUeSimpleSystem.png "
yes that is the one
please check it now
as I renamed it
to the new name
"yes, looks good"
thank you
great job
no prblem
if you'd like
i can add you to the www-data group
i am alrady there
ah
then all you have to do 
is find the pic you wish to replace in a dir under /var/www/modules/NS-My_eGallery/gallery
each catagory gets it's own dir
so the file of interest is something like
i thought this stuff was stored in mysql database
/var/www/modules/NS-My_eGallery/gallery/GNUe/GNUeFormsArchitecture.png 
not the pics
just the references to the pics
so you can copy over an existing pic as long as you don't rename it
"cool, thanks"
no prob
i understand it now
later
sorry it's taken so long

how cute
AMD is releasing the AMD Athlon XP processor
eXtra Proprietary?
oh my god!
mdean turned into a house!
http://advogato.org/article/372.html
jcater: what do you think of this? Is this what the FSF needs to focus on?
I think this is somewhat relevant to your guys LWCE complaints ;)
"
I personally would welcome a more proactive stance from FSF..."
"I kinda agree with the dude, although he is coming from another direction"
well that is why I said "somewhat"
"my concern is that the FSF should focus its resources converting people to the free cause, not preaching to the already converted."
"hey I was reading some discussions on the dotGNU lists and they were talking about a UI thin client, middleware etc. and I couldn't help but think of GNUe, what would yall think about GNUe/dotGNU integration somewhere down the road?"
what are they looking for?
we would need to get the to use python and forget about Java
;)
they don't have much code anyway
just p.net
"er, Portable.NET"
which merged
there are many parallels
I wanna closer at a few things after I get GSim released
"er, look closer"
GSim?
GNU Sim
a c++ simualtion library
uses GNU Common C++ and GNU Scientific Library
multi-threaded
OO programming grew out of simulatio langauges and stuff ya know
you ever hear  of Simula?
heard of it
"never used it, though"
they made us take this course in school "Modeling and Simulation"
It was a precursor to SmallTalk IIRC
I found it prety interesting and fun so I just decided to write this
hence my reason for not doing anything GNUe related for a while I have been hacking something else
bad chillywilly
you should spank yourself for that
"um, wait... no, don't do that"
"uh, ok"
that's masta's job ;)
what would he do with himself if he couldn't beat the coders?
go to DisneyLand?
haha
even masta's get a vacation
we should be going wild now that he is gone
a vacation without a laptop and internet?
frrrrreeeeeddoooooom
sounds more like hell to me

couple of years ago I had to spend a week w/my inlaws in Texas

yup
this one isn't too bad
PIII 450
160MB RAM
I am gonna build a new box soon
now that I am not poor
.. or at least chronically broke

hello all again
i am redoing my computer and have not had x windows running for a few months
but xfree86 is now installed and running
but i am again confused about window managers and desktops
how should i configure xwindows in this regard?
neilt: start with a stiff bourbon
you asking for a desktop suggestion?
or how to configure X?
a desktop and/or windowmanager suggestion
selection of
"jcater:  thats a given, with anything that is not a mac :)"
"well, with KDE you can simulate that MAC of yours :)"
"jcater:  ahh but i have the real thing, so its not memorex"
use Gnome
you running XFree86 ontop of your Mac?
jcater:  yes
"well, that rocks"
"jcater: not on top of, but in separate window"
G-N-O-M-E!!!
chillywilly:  ok so gnome
K-D-E!!!
i'll go get that
:)p
yay!
no kde
i go get that
kde bad
last one always wins
you can make Gnome look like Aqua
G-N-O-M-E!!!
TWM!!!
blackbox!!!
sawfish!!
windowmaker!!!
enlightenment
afterstep!!!
?
oroborus
try a bunch of them and pick what you like ;)
?
that will take too long
or be cool and use Gnome
i'll probably stick to the first one
actually kde is not listed in apt-get
it should be
so it'l have to gnome
gnome 1.4?
1.0.x sucks
yep 1.4 is listed
kewl
OS X uses apt?
"no, but fink does"
what is fink?
"hehe, nice name"
a layer on top of apt-get that automatically applies patches and configures debian packages for mac os x
cool
do you have a sources.list file then?
what debian distro you pulling packages from?
??
"stable, testing, unstable?"
all three
:)
"oh, ok"
"well debian's Gnome rules, imho"
i like to live on the wild side
"uh, too much information"
does slackware do binary packages?
or do you gotta compile it all?
yeah. they have packaging
but who wants precompiled binaries?
ppl who are impatient
:P
shit might as well to LFS then
I don't trust prebuilt stuff
or Gentoo Linux
they use ports and you get to compile it all
ooh! I love ports
I am sure it i faster though and probably a lot more kick ass
ports is pretty cool
don't you need pmake though?
I've been meaning to try Debian ports
pmake sux
no
gmake
good
Roland is the real masta ;)
when I grow up  wann be like him ;)
I wanna
dude!
gentoo looks cool
it's packaging is a Python-based Ports collection
"yea, I thought it looked pretty awesome"
I just don't like having to compile everything
I am lazy
although I am a kernel compile addict
I just can't help myself
wow! openafs looks cool too
wassat?
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/openafs.html
read the "What is AFS" section
"I'd heard of OpenAFS before, but didn't know what it was"
...just assumed it was like ReiserFS or XFS
oh
"ok, I think that was mention on the dotGNU developers list"
they were looking at it
man if I had another box to play with I would try gentoo out
night all
hey dude
hey
long time no see
whats the good word?
Yea
whatcha been up to?
I'm semi-homeless waiting on some jobs to engage
Mostly reading a lot
homeless?
sometimes the modem works and I can read email and such

you're not occupying the hsck squat anymore?
No

"looks like my best bet is working for the man for a while, my friend says theres a 70% chance his company will hire me"
I thought something bad like that had happened because you sorta disappeared
yea

*sigh*
and I'll be doing gnulinux stuff so its okay
for the most part
good
because they are migrating their servers to it

gnu maintainer?
yes
"gotta leave, my 4 year old wants to play GCompris :)"
GCompris?
morning
was there anything odd about widget placement in designer
that's an open ended question
can you be more specific
i can get mouse drag and drop motion working fine in Y axis
but X axis is going nuts
and I'm shifting positions based upon the grid sizing
did I scare you away ?
no
I'm thinking
I don't recall anything peculiar
you wanna commit what you have?
sure
hang on
"eri mean , brace yourself"
sigh
cvs conflicts
really?
where?
I don't recall working outside of GComm this whole weekend
they're old
I'm still building list
"btw, I am making a change in Designer's TemplateParser.py.. I'm assuming this won't conflict w/you"
nope
that's wierd
it told be conflict but couldn't find any
second checkin worked
"ok, it's commited"
jcater: what you adding?
I'm modifying the New Form Wizards so that the input fields are larger
(so you can actually read them)
cool
that'd be nice for 0.1.0
:)
"brb , need to raid the kitchen's caffeine "
supply
lol
back
you try the mouse thang?
yip
it's fscked up
?
what's it doing?
y was working without issue on my machine
x was screwed
that bad eh?
I don't think KDE likes xchat
what are you seeing in the mouse?
"problem is your mouse coordinates are relative to widget, not to panel.. but the mouse is moving according to panel coordinates"
I think
yip
however I couldn't move up the widget tree and get valid coords
so I moved everything (i thought) to the widget level
I pull the coords from the widget onLeftDown
and that seems to provide me the position within the widget
then I track the pointer motion within the widgets OnMotion also relative to the widget
lemme try something
sure
where is a good place to start? xml? python? php?
gemcat: what are you wanting to do?
welll jamest: id like to displace msn but doubt ill get that far
:)
let me rephrase
"are you wanting to work on core gnue tools, work on gnue apps, or just use the product"
well - i took a course on powerbuilder and sybase enterprise but cannot afford the licences
i am a planner by profession and doing things myself is kind of a last resort
jamest: think I got it.. give me a sec
as a participant maybe the report writer module - I have done something like that before
I really like infomaker - an open version would be nice
gemcat: I'm not familiar with infomaker
who does that?
it is sybase version of crystal reports
gotcha
jamest: I just committed changes to designer
"jcater: ok, new question"
"jamest: I moved the OnMotion stuff to the panel, but kept the left_down s tuff at the widget level"
in sybase they have unified the form designer and the reprot writer
forms is expecting the dbdrivers to raise DBError
however none of the new db drivers do that
so informaker can be used to make form templates
they raise errors from either GDataObjects or GConnections
so they are not caught and handled by forms
yeah.. I saw that
I was going to mention we should fix that before a release :)
where you planning a single exception raised to the app level or should I make forms handle the various errors at the app level
I think there are only two errors than need catching... all the GConnections errors stem from a common exception as di all the GDataObjects
there is a self.handleStartupError that nicely formats errors
as part of the common app class?
yes
but I thought I'd used it in forms somewhere
and you're ok with just dealing w/ the parent exceptions
"well, the child exceptions should be providing a decent error mesg that can be passed on (i..e, they should be fairly user-understandable)"
"if not, the child errors need rewording"
the new mouse code is freaking out
lol
we must have contradictory pcs
'cause your mouse code was freaking out for me :)
it doesn't move at all
oh
wtf
lol
works fine on labels
dies hard on entries
lol
gues what I was testing against?
btw - welcome to the living hell I've been messing with since yesterday
"well, at least labels work :)"
um
I can't find anything consistant
:)
I honestly don't know how to get entries to work
I couldn't trap the keystrokes reliably
I think this is a big problem w/wxWindows
also
it WON'T let go of some events
on the labels
the mouse slowly moves off the widget
"yeah, I know"
it's because the event system can't keep up with the movement
I didn't say it was perfect
sigh
"but, but, but"
"if you move slowly enough, it'll keep up"
:)
i expect perfect!
that's how mine worked too :)
your's didn't work in the x direction though :)
gemcat: i'm not sure we're after crystal reports
but we sure could use help
"jcater is the dude working on reports (and designer, and forms, and gcomm, and the kitchen sink)"
jamest: you know how some projects say to give thanks by sending pizza (or pizza coupons)...
jcater: can I play w/ mouse again or are you still in there
I think we should ask for tylenol :)
lol
tylenolware
"jamest: please, be my guest"
jamest: i can see that crystal reports might not fit your model - i got a book on xml otw - i will be around - thanks
gemcat: no problem
gemcat: we could use a windows tester
sounds like you may be a windows user?
i have w98 and NT4
"cool , most of us are *nix and even Mac OS X users"
so our windows testing is usually put off till the last minute :(
well i have to use nt at work
"i am getting another bok after thanksgiving - will have RH7, RH7.1, a firewall, and a NT4 hopefully"
cool
my firewall has some kind of bios probs - and I hope to setup the rh71 as a webserver/graphics machine
jamest: anything you wanna me to do in preparation?
for?
like that gnuef exception handling
release
the things we need (i think)
  db error handling
  the new designer template (with readable fields! :)
  mouse in designer (I think it'd help usability alot)
  docs up to date
    (for the gfd format)
  changelog updated
so pick what you like :)
"well, #2 is done"
right now I'm screwing up the mouse code again
I assume you are working on #3
I'll do #1 and then look at #4
I've never done #5
"  whoops, "
    win32 support fixed (I'm working on that too when wife isn't on her system)
"well, tell her jason said get off :)"
j/k
she might hurt me!
don't really tell her that
"actually, she's done w/ it for now"
but I'm banging on the mouse thing
I didn't need to know that
i registered at your website
bbl
jcater: :)
argh!!
yes?
pygresql
argh!!
it defines a standard set of exceptions
lemme guess
but it throws exceptions defined in its c module
they match
argh!
I wonder if anyone associated w/pygresql ever actually used the pgdb interface??
as it's laden w/bugs
no idea
I gave up on it and went pyscop IIRC
or popy
or something
:)
one of those just released a new version
oops
we have not updated the ODBC driver to reflect new GDataObject model
jamest: you still here?
sorry back
went on an errand w/ lindsay
"for the old ODBC driver, were you using PythonWin's builtin driver, or mxODBC?"
IIRC it had settings for both
ah
hmm
jade was the last person to work on that driver
we have any docs on our ODBC support?
like example datasources :)
used to :)
they are documented (the gfd syntax) in the ref guide
argh!
I guess I need to install lyx
:)
look at the web copy of the docs
hmm
speaking of docs
I guess I need to start on reports and designer docs at some point
<sigh>
lol
um
is odbc in heavy use anywhere?
"i.e., can I change the format? :)"
no it's not
and I didn't like the gfd format to begin with
so feel free to change it
ok
I'm going to make the provider='odbc' and take all the special meaning out of it
(that overly complicated stuff)
YES!
exactly what I was hoping for :)
"the subproviders, etc can go into the service="""" string"
argh!
yes
"mouse, evil"
I agree
you still working on that?
:)
oh crap
tell me 
why is self.instance.gridHeight = 21 when the widget is only about 13 pixels?
um
I dunno
volume?
I copied those calculations from UIwxpython
that's my only excuse
you poor bastard
but it draws correctly
??
:)
there is some voodoo in UIwxpython
hmm
"well, then"
as you can't really get the height/width of a font set
I guess you could say Designer is "dabbling in voodoo" :)
in wxwindows
go figure
I am confused
but that's no surprise
it gives a value but it's not right
lol
as its the text in the widget not the widget itself
sounds like a solid algorithm to me :)
or some bullshit
i don't recall the details beyond the fact that I'd rather not recall the details
as it was a PITA
lol
there are quite a few wxWindowisms
Designer has quite a few
especially when dealing w/events!
gawd that was a nightmare
tell me about it
<sigh>
now I have to install xforms for lyx
speaking of designer
bwahahahahahaah
i have something I want you to try
ok
update from cvs
and try the new mouse code
i moved things back into the widget handler btw :)
We're playing musical OnMotion
and it works there?
yes
?
what?
just teasing
:)
"well, x works beautifully"
Y is a bit odd
you must move more than 1/2 a girdwidth in y
so click at top of widget and move down 
and it shoudl jump ok
"but to move back up, you have to reclick at top"
you have to reclick at bottom
and move upward more than 1/2 a widget :(
also I'm still wearing my wxTextControl made me it's bitch t-shirt
i don't know
"but for 0.1.0, it looks perfect :)"
I'm close on the entry widgets
"honestly, you think so?"
and I'm sick of it
and = as
:)
sure
I can branch it too
and do a 0.1.1 later on
what's next big ticket in designer?
'cause I'd like to adapt your code for resizing the widgets too
well
need to clean up the UI system
... add drag and drop support for automatically pulling fields/datasources
... generalize the designer code so that it can be used w/reports/etc
... use BOA (if installed) for code editing
but I'm not sure of the priorities
so on our list
argh
"sorry, didn't see your stuff"
"    (actually, BOA will give us CVS editing, etc)"
on the prerelease list
but that's low on my priority list :)
from today
where are we?
um
if we say mouse is done for now
and I switch to win32
I cleaned up the exception handling
it works now?
but it could be tested better :)
bwahahaha
I think so
right now I'm working on ODBC
which wasn't on our list
whoops!
but I thought might be important
:)
insert a duplicate key into table
hmmmm
gnuef used to generate pop up dialogs and recover when a dberror was encountered
now it's doing things like
GFForm: Unexpected Exception:
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
"  File ""/home/jamest/cvs/gnue/gnuef/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFForm.py"", line 336, in commit"
<snip>
ConnectionError: ERROR:  Cannot insert a duplicate key into unique index zipcode_pkey
 
"INSERT INTO zipcode (zip,state,city) VALUES ('66506','KS','MANHATTAN')"
------------------------------------------------------------
is that what you added?
oops
no
:)
"ok, so that's still on our list"
dcc me some
"oh, wait.. I'm using NAT"
sigh
:)
damn
"ok, think I got it"
damn?
"yes, damn"
gnue.py is installed in python20/lib
so it's screwing up in not finding python20/gnue/*
hmm
I want to look at gnue.py again today
maybe we should just comment that out of setup.py and save it for later
I want to get GNUe.py working as I think that'll be very useful (although I *really* wanted it in the 0.1.0 release :(  )
well
I'm trying to remember what we're currently using it for
currently
nothing
(except for non-GNUe uses of gnue-common)
"well, is that my non-gnue use of gnue-common?"
or is someone else using it
no one yet
I was planning on it
could we simply rename?
yes
gnue-config.py?
fine w/me
or we're we putting more than config stuff in there?
um
not exactly sure yet
"right now, that's all I was thinking (plus it could modify self.path)"
gnue-sys.py?
that might work
all lowercase ok w/ you?
yip
will dashes cause any problems?
we'll find out soon :)
"yes, yes it does"
I know; I know... import argh
"yes, it works; or, yes, it caues problems?"
cause problems
gnue-sys = gnue minus sys
:)
as least it seems to not like it much
lol
yes we want to take over the system
so it must be gnue - sys :)
:)
argh!
i can't make it stop installing GNUe.py
:)
a little thing like changing the name in setup.py doesn't seem to help :)
whoever wrote that must've been on crack
i don't recall who wrote it
so I'll agree
and hope it was you :)
now that's just evil
what?
there's a LOT of voodoo going on w/distutils
sigh
it's not in setup.py at all
yet gnue.py won't die!
rm -f build.1
rm -rf build.1
i did that
oh
dang.. that's one helluva setup program then :)
:)
argh!
wha?
argh!
I dunno
I'm giving feedback on commit errors
but it's not recovering like I'd expect
hmm
it may be a flaw in GDataObjects
"I think we need to save the state of a record before a commit attempt; in case of a problem during a commit, the earlier records need to reset their unsaved state"
oooo
re
jamest: can I get your opinion?
I have two options here
"1.  Each recordset, when asked to commit, can save their state and implement a method that can be called that will restore that state, or"
"2. Do a 2-stage commit in which the first state, it saves all data to the database and the second state (after all records are saved) it resets its internal data"
"or, 3. Pretend like I didn't see this problem :)"
<sigh>
"Of course, 2 won't work with a database driver that doesn't do transactions"
but there's no reliable way of knowing if transactions are working
"of course, anyone who uses a non-transactional system w/a system like this needs their head examined anyway :)"
jamest: did I lose you?
:)
hmm
I'm trying to remember how the old system worked
I was hoping for more than a smiley :)
i was thinking it'd hold the records in memory
so you could correct the problem and resubmit
but it was all or nothgin
so any error would attempt to rollback the databases
right
that's how it does it now
and if the db didn't support transactions that's the db admins problem
:)
lol
I guess method #2 would be best
as it could also be used to 
requery that particular record for 
databases that support it
uggh
I wasn't expecting all this :(
hmm
can we wait until a later version for this and 
put a disclaimer in the README that says
WARNING: DON'T MAKE MISTAKES WITH THIS PROGRAM
:)
i guess so
i guess I don't understand the problem
what's not recovering?
ok
say I query 10 records
I have a resultset with 10 recordsets
I change the first 3 
which causes the _updateFlag's to be set on those records
and I insert a new record at the end
I go to commit the changes
and it performs the updates on the first 3
and resets the _updateFlag (since they've been updated)
then inserts the last one
but it generates an error
so the 3 updates are rolled back
I need to save those _updateFlag s in case this happens
ah
I'm not sure whether I should save the flags in a temporary variable
and then implement a method that can be called in case of a later failure that restores them
or do a 2-step commit
in which all the db activity takes place
and then all the internal consistency resets take place
I'm now wondering if #2 would add more overhead than #1
as all records would be traversed twice instead of once
well
"but then again, I'm not sure"
on #2 are you worried about the extra lag in the UI
no... this has nothing to do with forms or the UI
i mean during it's resetting of the internal state
(which btw will be more complicated w/ record caching :)
sigh
"yes, that is a concern"
any suggestions??
I'd say ignore
for the 0.1.0 of common
as the geas driver updates will require a 0.1.x release anyway
ok
and this won't effect forms at all
are the exceptions working now?
yip
"well, kinda"
damn
i have gnuef working under 2.0 python
I'm committing if you wanna try
and now I can't find a binary postgresql driver for python 2.0 on windows 
:(
all I can find are for 2.1
figures
hehe
can I update yet?
yes
ok
oops.. it updated my incomplete odbc file
don't assume that's working :)
:)
login w/ invalid name aborts program
commit errors handled nicely
argh!
the former should abort after 4 bad attempts
lemme look
hasn't done that since the new drivers were brought online :)
that I recall
"yeah, yeah"
"well, i can't test windows db drivers"
as I can't find a fscking binary and I don't have a c compiler to build drivers from source
btw I'm in GConnections
commited small change in there
grrr designer won't install on win32
i think I'm going to go practice some taekwondo for a bit with the wife
k
be be in about 1 hr
have fun
then I'll try and get desginer working on win32
it complains about missing templates or something after an install 
hmm
well
does it even install on linux :)
dunno :)
i'll check later :)
back
:)
"for a few, she's budy"
she kick your butt that quickly?
busy
twice
ok
fixed the login bombing problem
"you now have 4 chances, then it bombs :)"
and it's committed
cool
lol
gfdesigner doesn't install on linux either
hmmm
it's not installing the tempaltes
:)
but
hmm
you've got them listed in the package dir
wierd
so it seems it should be installing them
<sigh>
I love distutils
got it
i think
yip
mucho excellante
"well, it installs"
I still need to run it :)
I'm guessing wizards won't work
argh
"that bad, eh?"
:)
you know much about ODBC dsn's??
in a previous life (circa 1993) I used them a fair amount
what's wrong?
what's the standard for a dsn?
how do they look normally?
I used them in VB and IIRC they seperated everything out into specific arguemnts
and to set them up I used odbc manager
I don't recall any ascii configs
"I've noticed recently that odbc has system, user, and IIRC file dsns"
but I don't recall having to ever deal w/ that
sigh
rock!
yes?
designer will now install on windows and linux and wizards (on linux) work fine
:)
however......
:(
running designer on windows results in 
This program has performed an illegal op.......
have you run with -d#
to see how far it gets?
just did
uiwxpython line 67
wxapp initializing3
then it bombs
sigh
wife is now ready to practice
ok
I'm commiting and will look at when I return
was there anything else I needed to test?
I dunno
hey hey hey
chillywilly: 'sup
deadlock is what is up :(
gah
?
2 threads waiting on each other
maybe one of them got suspended and still holds a mutex? ugh!
in designer?>
no
that thing I was working on
GSim?
yep
chillywilly: you remember when masta's getting back?
nope
He said "A week".  I guess that was from Tue or Wed.
ok
I say leave the man be :P
like he'd do that with us
:)
"jamest: I got LyX installed, but it doesn't know what to do with the docbook-book textclass"
any suggestions?
debian system?
"now, jamest"
'course not
ah
that'd be to simple
"well, I think you'd have to find the sgmltools rpms"
ok
as I think they provide docbook support
hmm
how do you do the away messages?
 /away message
ahhhhh
pizza
gimme some
:)
we got roats though
"er, roast"
been cooking for a couple hours
smeels damn good
smells even
"you got goats, you say?"
goat roast
yes
mmm mmm mmm
no more goat raping when you just decide to kill the bastards
you're just sick
look who's talking
sourceforge down?
buuuuuurrrrrp!
don't be rude
don't make me trout slap you then
hah
i am sooo scared of the trout
"damn, "
that was close
:)
ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hi :)
hi
figured woudl check email as it might take a bit (looks like about 1100 out there)
btw: disney might be money hungry greedy suns a biotchs
but they know how to make amusement parks
bbs
"yeah, i hear they put funs things to do there instead of crappy things"
the nerve
disney licks my bag
wb derek (masta)
chillywilly: really?
how much t5hey charge for that/
?
too much
greedy bastards
it is still 0 to 0
:(
booooooring
oh crap
d-backs are up sheet creek
hehe
does anyone here speak French? :)
derek: hey   do you want me to help at ALS?
i'm available
scary..
dereks off playing
jamest: ok
but I don't think we have anyone there
does anyone else know what's up with gnue and als?
he axed me a couple weeks ago but hasn't responded to my emails
i sent it to dneighbo@gnue.org -- is that best?
jamest: weren't you planning a dawn raid on ALS to setup a grand GNUe booth?
ajmitch: I think the grand raid was on the visiting Cheerleading Camp
and I don't think it had anything to do w/GNUe
"ah, ok"
:P
lol
rofl
"so, those diamondbacks get creamed yet"
dtm: i speak french
dtm: derek@gnue.org is best
btw: the dbacks won :)
about time
checkout cvs and start testing there disney-boy
hehe
were trying to do a release here 
"yeah, you leave for a week and we get work done"
a coincidence?
rofl
hehe
rofl
no kidding over 1000 emails and 800 are from the cvs commit list
geez
commits on what parts?
sigh
I hate computers
"why is that, o jcater?"
they are a pita
who told you you could start eating
"we're talking forms, designer, common 0.1.0s in the pipeline"
and youre talking pitas
btw: i think i have convinced that next gnue conference can be in kansas city
provided opening day is at worlds of fun
what about GEAS?
i have no idea on geas
the geas driver for gnue-common will be a 0.1.1 release
i can tomorrow though
as it needs more work 
part of the motivatoin to moving to 0.1.0 is we can relase tiny things like that w/o requireing new forms/designer
derek: but we decided while you were gone to have a developers conference ... in Vegas!!
"err, at least I decided that"
"'course, I could live w/being the only one there"
"hey, what about NZ?"
hmm
"if I could afford to get there, I'd *love* to visit NZ"
lol
doesn't cost that much to swim
from tennessee?
I'm landlocked
"oh, my condolences"
I can see my kitchen sink from here
put some wheels on that then
and a motor
"when you get to the see, put the plug in, & start paddling"
(but that's because my bro-in-law hasn't gotten his crap outta my office)
s/see/sea/
rofl
l8r
vegas works for me
derek: ok so you've told me how to reiterate my question to you.  :)
its drivable
it's pretty hard to be landlocked in NZ :)
"derek: can you translate this to french?  ""Have a seat and rest your feet, please."""
derek: i also have a verse
I can translate that to USA Southern: "seet yar arse down thar"
"derek:  ""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."""
um that would be an odd translation
as have a seat and rest
are both reposer
to rest
matt 11:28
i.e. to them that is redundant
jcater: hehe thanks
derek: that's fine
"derek: grab a french translation & look it up then, i can't remember french that well :)"
s'il vous plait repos
woul be please rest
"derek: i'd prefer that verse, but i'll fall back on something simpler as long as it's French and ends in ""please"""
ok
"prenez un seige et reposez vos pieds, s'il vous plait"
that is
"'take a seat and rest your feet, please'"
literally
"im sure there is a french slang equiv some how, but i just learned from lousy highschool french teacher :)"
heh
it's been a couple of years since i took french at HS...
derek: so how about that verse?
night all
jcater: take care
on that one probably best to go online
to a french bible translation
and enter that verse
and get a real translation
"Venez a moi, vous tous qui etes accabl?s sous le poids d'un lourd fardeau, et je vous donnerai du repos."
better than me giving a 'literal' one
xchat don't like accented characters
http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matt+11%3A28&version=BDS-IBS&showfn=yes&showxref=yes&language=french
ajmitch: wow
thanks guys
derek: so what about ALS?
i thought it already left
eh?  you say ALS is over with
?
what's its url
i thought it was this last weekend?
no?
?
it's in Nov
ah nov 5th - 10th
heh
we dont have a booth and arent piggy backed on any booth 
i didnt know if you were available so i didnt configure anything with FSF
FSF will be there and surely you can promote us there :)
derek: oh i gues syou didn't get the email
i have been gone :(
derek: i emailed dneighbo@gnue.org
derek: ok
just got home tonight
ahhh
well ihopeyou had a good trip
yes VERY good
didnt want to come back
ok
awww
where to?
disneyland/california adventure
wow
i went to disneyland once
it was nice
and cheap entry
ajmitch: thanks a lot man   that url works great
ajmitch: this is going on some art my mom's making and selling
on a chair
"heh, ok"
selling it to someone from church
so thanks guys
cool
disney can kiss my arse!!!
actually I am in the mood where I feel like saying hey everyone can kiss my arse
weeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"thank you for granting us that capability, dan."
i'll cherish it
that's good to know
hey
ra3vat
hello Mr_You
you have madlockes code?
I really would like to start working with it
lo?
Mr_You: yes I have
doo de
but can't get it working
can you send it somehow?
email?
you install the latest webware beta?
cvs version
ok
I hope I can hack on it ;-)  first python experience hehe
whee
http://people.vitalit.com/car/neatgoat.gif
sent
danke
so this does not connect via GEAS?
(yet?)
it's just form's ui driver
oh yeah.. 
Mr_You: I still do not understand what should be placed on webware's side to run a form
KC GNUe 3 is now up
I will do an announce to the gnuenterprise.org portal
and the gnue-discuss mailing list
psu: you here?
yep
"sorry, busy in another window"
back now
what is the procees to get KC translated into other languages? except just translating :)
process
There is a standard format for the mark-up
which is explained on the KC web site
"however, that should be language-independant."
I know Zack Brown has translations of other KCs 
so I assume he has all the issues sorted out
"Main one that occours to me is that when I quote, "
I quote absolutely verbatim
ie word for word what was said
usually including any spelling/grammer mistakes
obviously this would get lost in the translation
"but not really an issue, I think"
http://kt.zork.net/trans.html
"At the moment, the only Kernel Cousins with translations "
are the main Linux Traffic 
usually quotes/terms left verbatim and "optional" translate also given
"(Czech, French, German, Korean, Spanish, Polish)"
and Debian KC has a Czech translation
Korean one uses non-Latin character set 
so that's obviously not an issue.
do you advice to contact Zack Brown to start this?
I would encourage anyone with an interest 
to contact Zack 
"oops, typed across each other there."
ok
tell him I said hi ;-)
:)
<zbrown@tumblerings.org>
"ok, thanks"
I would put in the Russian for "peace be on you KC GNUe-translating efforts"
but I don't know it...
otherwise I'd do a Russian KC myself.
"Like most English people,"
I have a little bit of very rusty schoolboy French
"la plume de ma tante"
etc
OMG
just noticed I called Jason "Jeff" again
thanks for the tip-off
resubmit going in right away
this is beginning to get not funny
this time I definantly deserve a trout-slapping
"no, the other kind"
you asked for it :)
off to see how much of the French Kernel Traffic I can understand
hi ajmitch
hi
any luck with uiwebware?
i didn;t get the code
why not?
dunno ;)
i gues madlocke never got around to sending it
hi psu
another KC done :)
hi aj
yep
still managed to call Jason "Jeff" in places
heh
dunno how I managed that
correction already gone to Zack
I look like a bozo
and how you can't clik on post by each person by their name?
not sure what you mean - there is an authors index
somwher
"but at moment, I am polluting it "
rather badly
with both jcaters
not just one
previous weeks have had a link to the authors beside each quote by the name
as well as potentially rubbing Jason up the wrong way
I'll check that 
heh
I hadn't noticed that
either Zack has changed the format
or I've screwed up the mark-up
hi neilt
hello all
hello aj
ok..
back
"some small progress with UIwebware, i don't think forms likes an old pre 2 python :)"
but apart from that it must be loading the right stuff for my tracebacl to include webware & gnuef stuff ;)
where do you place the driver?
i chucked it in gnuef/src
then ran setup.py install
which landed it in /usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/forms

hey neilt
hi neilt
didn't see you're here
anybody know a way to quickly rename 146 files from uppercase filenames to lowercase filenames?
anyone gonna be at LinuxWorld NYC in January?
"nope, except copy dir list to a file and create a shell script"
my text editor will convert them
then a little copy and paste
reinhard: what about tr?
 #!/bin/sh
          cat "$@" \
            | tr -s '[:punct:][:blank:]' '\n' \
            | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
            | uniq -d
can do some variation on that

I'd like to jeep things that way
keep
speak of the devil
every time i write a shell script
i ask myself how i ever could write dos batch files that actually _did_ something
morning all
morning jcater
morning jc
"reinhard: yeah, dos is hell"
james and I have been testing forms on windows
and we can't even scroll back to see the full errors reported
and we can't redirect errors to a file!
omg
at least using the traditional command.com
happy splitting!
jcater: scrollback is my #1 piss me off :)
about dos
"hey derek, good morning"
:)
derek: is #fsfeurope and #gnubiz still as dead as it used to be?
disagreeing with someones opinion or approach is way different than having a problem with them as a person
yes
"but otoh, having a problem with someone as a person makes it easier to disagree with his opinion"

argh!
I'm out of anise pods for my poached pears
bbiab
fucking cat!
I am gonna kill that damn thing
it jumped up onto my desk and knocked shit all over and upplugged my modem
chillywilly: wait till it learns how to press the reset button!
reinhard: seriously?
no
:)
heheh
i would like to see a cat press ctrl-alt-delete :)
lol

wait till it decides to 'mark its territory' and considers your PC its territory...
"uh, no way dude"
why chillywilly your PC smells like ammonia....
that cat will die then
"chillywilly: 'shut up dood, the cat ....'"
it is a female though
oh
so I don't think that will be happening
plus if I am always on my computer how will it get near it to do that?
;)
anyone ever watch mystery science theatre 3000?
where this guy and 2 robots watch old movies and make funny comments
wb jc
yo psu
yo cw
good KC
thanks
you almost make it sound like i understand what i am saying
I still managed to call Jason "Jeff" a few times ;-(
I thought I read that ine a few days ago
one
psu: naughty naughty
did you submit to linuxtoday?
i'm here for a trout-slapping as punishment
"derek - happens automagically, I'm told"
psu: it is setup like that?
"what - linuxtoday, KC or your trout?"
linuxtoday
I think so. All the KCs end up on linuxtoday
not sure if Zack pushes or linuxtoday pulls
as it were
:)
"i think they are probably pushed,but i could be wrong"
"if you call jason jeff, call him jeff carter :)"
its an 'inside joke' (the carter part)
heheh
hrrm
hey jeff carter what's up?
nevermind babysitter showed
i get to stay
babysitter?
the wife isn't around?
wife is here
we are having yardsale
thought it would take most of day to get garage clean and wife was to teach aerobics class
daughter had soccer game so wife got babysitter to take daughter to game
then ended up being able to find a substitute for her class
dude I am sick of political correctness
normally i would have called the babysitter and taken daughter
BUT been a long time since the babysitter has come over and the kids adore her
they WANTED her and not me to take them :)
man chewing through email is a pian
pain
been at it over an hour and still have like 45 to go
sigh
mmmmm im on like myh 5th donut this morning.... getting bad habits from jcater
heheh
btw: jcater what is release status?
what needs testing?
what needs fixing...
etc etc etc
i have some time
derek: can you do a sample intro form??
I'm on the way out of town
we are having issues w/designer on win32
"after that, we release :)"
ok
"btw, issues w/designer on win32 isn't reason I'm on the way out of town"
any specs on said form?
rofl
im thinking a tabbed form
um
tabs
where every tab is a sample
no datasources of course
so like
tab <entry>
tab combo
tab grid
tab button
etc etc
etc
do tabs work in designer?
you can set them up
but you only see one atg a time in designer
"i.e., each tab is a separate ""grid"""
otay
derek: we have request from "Michael Brown (mcb30)" <mbrown@fensystems.co.uk>
for assignment paperwork
please expedite if possible
he already has code to send us for geas
to make C and pyhton methods work at the same time
neilt-away: I already sent him the stuff
cool
thanks
derek: hope that was ok
did it yesterday afternoon
be back tonight
l8r
neilt-away: its happening
i told him to send the patch he had to info@gnue.org and we would apply it w/o copyright fully completed
as its a minor patch
relatively speaking
and the paperwork is started
"cool, thanks"
also told him generally we dont give cvs immediately
we usually require several patches first
even with copyright assignment
"ok, reinhard and I will check out the quality of the patches"
and let you know
just fyi we started doing this cause too many people sent assignment but never did code
or only sent one patch and disappeared
sounds good
and the work of fighting with FSF hackers to create and destroy accounts is too painful unless its a regular contributor :)
is reinhard on the distribution for info@gnue.org?
um i think so
he was not
i just added him though :)
i need sleep
nah
sleep is for the weak or non-caffienated
(same thing ;) )
derek: thanks for subscribing me to info@gnu.org
iirc i wanted to subscribe but somehow i forgot
am I subscribed?
dude I wish mailman was more like an account where you could login then just some forms and crap
chillywilly: i guess only the "sub-maintainers" are subscribed
then I could modify my email address for lists without having to unsubscribe and then resubscribe
eh?
sub-maintainers?
wtf is that?
well at least that is what i would call it
like the official maintainers for the overall project are jamest and derek
but the defacto maintainer of reports is jcater
the defacto maintainer of geas are neilt and me
"and I am a nobody, yes I see your point"
i would happily change jobs with you i think
having responsibility for a part of the project is no easy job
being a contributor is far easier :)
what would you think of business objects being parsed into GObjects?
can you explain more?
ok
what it would mean and what we would gain from it
basically we derive a modifiable object form GObject that ha s ahash table or whatever for methods and fields
this way we can update the object on the fly
by reparsing the gcd files
but we get real inheritance too
evertually these GObject will talk to our OO communication abstraction layer
so they can alos be remote
hmmm
are you creating some struct that is supposed to be a business object?
aren't
why not have areal Object system instaed of a C struct
actually i have now a strut with a hash table for methods and fields
yes
yes
that can be adapted to a GObject and we gain all the cool stuff
well not a hash table but a double-linked list for some reasons
run time type checking
signals and slots
etc.
inheritance
not inheritance imho
you gonna so all that crap yourself?
or would you make each business object its own gobject class?
liek make the strict contain the parent as a member?
ummm
maybe just a generic one
i mean
like it is now
would you register item as an object class
have to think about it
and customer as one
etc
i think that would be full bloated in the end
and if you just have a single generic one
C objects just aen't very modifiable that is what sorta sucjs
you won't have inheritance
you have to have inheritance
i had a close look at GObject some time ago
that's how you extend OO stuff
and it's a good idea in principle
you biuld a framework
but it adds a lot of overhead
and extend it to do specific things
like for my simualtion library you have to derive form the GSim object the Simulation object and the SimEvent and/or SimProcess objects
"over load the proper methods, etc."
yeah
there are cases where you gain a lot from oop
why go half OO when you can use an Object system that exists and base things from that? We can still have one interface to all objects to reduce marshalling
and there are cases where you don't
well an app serve that si supposed to serve objects only makes sense to be OO
imho
"anyway, soon as I release GSim"
I am gonna look at your parser and GObject and see what I can come up with
if that is ok
sure
seeing code is always better than just talking :)
helps a lot to understand
yes
I do a lot of talking I know
:P
I just have to get this other thing done
it is haunting me
"btw derek: i added michael brown to the list of sponsors, i hope that's ok"
chillywilly: np
the good thing about free software projects is that there is no strict timeline :)
thanks for understanding
chillywilly: i basically understand you 100%
which doesn't mean that I agree 100%
but I understand at least :)
what is there to disagree about?
chillywilly: you are more the type to push forward
i am a type to "slow down" so to speak
hmmm
where i mean i tend to think twice before doing something
I am not sure what you mean
ok
not sure if that is good or bad
you mean I am unruly and ijust hack away?
:P
you are easy to fill with enthusiasm
i am not
oooh
yes I get nuts about things
;)
you are open for new ideas
i am rather a precautious type
ok
not that i am conservative
I get you now
ok
wrt if it's good or bad
i can say for 100% sure
it's GOOD to have both extremes in the project
as when you start to run blindly into some random direction
i can try to stop you
and when i am too stubborn about things
you can kick my butt :)
well I just want to do real OO coding in C and GObject lets you do that
to a better degree than anything I can come up with
yea
I always got my trout with me
;P
lol
bbl
rofl
rm-away: definitely cool you add him as sponsor
and i agree its 100% good to have varying dependencies w/in gnue
wrt to personalities
it provides built in check and balance system
"bah, I need thread safe C++ I/O"
maybe I should contribute some to GNU Common C++?
hi sevik
hi mcb30
hi
hello mcb30
mcb30: 
as an aside
are you familiar with the gnu coding standards?
(if yes please forgive the question) :)
not at all
maybe you might want to read them
just a sec i'll give you the url
sorry can't reach www.gnu.org at the moment
will give you later
ok
it's just a list of some hints
to make code more standardized
i basically copied the style from the existing code
e.g:
if
  {
that's good in any case :)
    code
  }
yep
btw sorry for the burocracy (sp?)
although "switch" seemed to be indented differently as
switch {
fsf has made several bad experiences in the past
for example they took big contributions from people
and later found out that somebody has copyright on that contributed code
and objected to gpl it
bureaucracy is OK as long as it doesn't hinder actual work - a 3/4 week delay before being able to commit is verging on being a hindrance...
for example the employer of the person
mcb30: tp create a patch form cvs just do "cvs fidd > file.patch"
s/tp/to
woops
and they had to sort out that stuff again
cvs diff < file.patch
dman
tye again
try
I know what you mean
cvs diff > file.patch
there
that's the one
"yes, hadn't thought of that rather obvious way to do it (d'oh!)"
bbl
also I think it is common practice everywhere to not give out cvs commit access willynilly
mcb30-away: http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html is the link
on the subject of coding standards: why is there no debug_output macro within geas?
like the ones in other parts of GNUe?
and is there a standard that indicates when it is (un)acceptable to use return() in the middle of a function?
void
SimEvent::setSuspend ()
{
  suspendlock.EnterMutex ();
  suspended = true;
  Suspend ();
bad chillywilly
suspend the thread wihtou releasing the lock
doh!
mcb30: I think that is just some CS proffs hang ups
;)
they claim that multiple return paths makes it harder to figure out what is going on
or something
I forget the reason exactly
no - I nearly created a memory leak when patching yesterday because memory is allocated at the start of a function and then has to be freed at each of the possible exit points
aaah
well that's a good reason not to have multiple return paths
I restructured the routine so that there was only a single exit point - made it easier to read as well (it was a routine I was modifying anyway)
ignore my comment about debug_output; was grepping the wrong part of the source code.
you should post your patch to the list
that's probably a good way for us to do things as the hurd does that too with ppl who do not have direct cvs access but contribute
then ppl can look at it and discuss things if need be
or just commit it
:)
mcb30: i think it was just undisciplined programming :)O
is there a site to learn python?
i.e. the original author of those routines not thinking big picture
nickr: if you know a computer language already
you know python by default :)
heh.
I just need to know the restrictions.
it really is that clean
the restrictions are not much
you can make it behave like a functional language like lisp etc
even
Hows tha?
Is there a Dictionary or associative array data type?
you asking me?
cause I don't know (assuming this is geas)
Request: does python_execute_function() in method_python.c actually do anything useful?  It doesn't get called by anywhere
"no, and I shouldn't be this lazy anyway"
nickr: python has a dictionary
python does not do "encapsulation" well
"i.e., no private, public, etc."
I never use that anyway
no better than OO C stuff
well if you are a good programmer you will not use fields that aren't supposed to be used directly you will call a method ;)
I never access members in my objects
that's good practice
does ObjC have protection mechanisms?
I don't think so
not surprising
;)
Either you can't access members directly or you can't protect them
I think its the former
"Even if it isn't, nobody does it anyway"
you shouldn't
"nickr: python is easy, I am sure you'll pick it right up"
my girlfriend convinced me to help her write her Python oregon trail game
So don't think I'm selling out or something.
selling out?
pyton rocks
nickr: http://www.diveintopython.org
how do I negate a boolean?
er?
foo = 1
!foo
how?
mcb30: three things
1. if you find a function that is never called it is probably a left-over from one of the numerous code reorgs :)
2. re: what derek said
<derek> i.e. the original author of those routines not thinking big picture
"to save my reputation: i am not the original author, neither is neilt :)"
3. you seem to have some thoughts about coding style
i have started a little project collecting ideas about good coding style
http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/style-guide/
if you are bored please take a look and give your input :)
"okay, Python IS pretty easy."
I think I can make a preprocessor that turns Python into Objective C
haha
that's what you mean by selling out? Not writing it in Objective C?
nickr: cool
I would use it immediately
long love objective-c
s/love/live
I think its pretty esaily done
at least for the class definition part
which is the part I hate most about objc
"nickr: i have never written anything in objective-c, but its the native language for all the new mac stuff so it has to be the best :)"
Hah
"I love the core language, because I like C to start with, and it adds a very friendly OO layer"
"but OpenStep, oy"
neilt: that's a lame reason
chillywilly:  could be
but i suspect not
I suspect that forming an opinion of something you haven't used is always lame
"but I have looked at it, and I have seen total apps written with 100 lines of code.  So its not only the language, but also the power of the frameworks that come alone also. You really dont think I would form an opinion soly on that do you?"
"the frameworks are ugly but easy, imho"
I'm writing my own base classess so I can be closer to the meat
"ny fugly, you mean non-intuitive?"
s/ny/by
"Hmm, no"
neilt: well what do you think? I am the "irrational" one
I mean 'created by someone who's assumptions about data modeling are different than mine and so not comfortable for me to use'
chillywilly:  i would say you are opinionated
"not irrational, at least based on what I see"
nickr: :)
therefore I set out to make a class library that models data the way I look at things
"nickr: yes, i love the freedom of this new world, dont like it do it yourself"
nickr: GNU Common ObjC?
:P
chillywilly: no.
nickr: you should make it a GNU project ;)
nickr: as you don;t care for GNUStep right?
night all
Correcti
night
it will do a lot of what common C++ does
"I'm not going to write it all asa  theoretically perfect base class library, though"
It'll be easier if I just write them as I use them
"I have linked lists and strings, thats all I need right now"
"well dude that's how GNU Common C++ came to be just factored out code from Bayonne, iirc"
i've just uploaded sample form with non-ascii labels for test purposes to:
http://www.gnuenerprise.org/~dimas/samples/forms/helloworld2_ru.gfd
er
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~dimas/samples/forms/helloworld2_ru.gfd
chillywilly: neat.
mcb30:  you here?
"mcb30: i have no way to compile and test, is anyone here that can check mcb30's changes to assure they dont break cvs (ie they compile)"
if i check them in
"ok, here we go anyway"
yes I'm here
changes are commited to cvs
thanks
would you checkout and make sure they work
just about to do it
all ok
"make clean ; make" and it works
cool
neilt: although there are a couple of probs I had with the Makefiles - are you any good with autoconf/automake?  (I don't know anything about them)
nope that is reinhard
that does all of the make for geas
it's probably a general question
basically it doesn't pick up my python libraries properly
(was doing this even before my patches)
hmmm
how did you run ./autogen.sh
it picks up -lpython but not -L/usr/lib/python2.1/config
yes
oh
just "autogen.sh --enable-methods=python"
then modifed config.h to use glibmodules methods as well
"yea, unfortunately it is sucky like that"
then ran the make
you should hack it ;)
now that they both work together
or someone else can
I never figured out how the whole autoconf/automake thing worked -
"I've done lots of rpm-building and the ones that use auto{conf,make} and go wrong are always the worst :-("
mcb30: I have some nice tutorials if you are willing to read
ok
i dropped a note to reinhard
he should get it tomorrow
thanks
and he has been very good with the configure system
I think I can figure out how to change --enable-methods=xxx to --enable-methods-python and --enable-method-glibmodule
chillywilly: cool
mcb30: http://www.amath.washington.edu/~lf/tutorials/autoconf/
cheers
"chillywilly: be ssure to check that on or the other and both is ok, but none is not acceptable"
mcb30: well if you want to do it go ahaed
mcb30: how does it work right now with your changes?
The "provider" list that each methods_*.c implemented is now common and held in methods.c instead
I added a field to the provider list that is an enum type saying which "language" the method is in (python/glibmodule)
"eeek, man I really need real OO ;)"
Each methods_*.c had an execute_method function that scanned the provider list looking for a match and then invoked it
yea
I made that code common to both and put it in methods.c
you run the test thatexecutes a python method?
so now methods.c does the scanning the list and when it finds a match it dispatches it to the relevant methods_*.c
"Yes, I wished I was using an OO language as well :-)"
mcb30: just another reason to use the new glib and GObject ;)
don't get the question: "you run the test thatexecutes a python method?"
you can setup geas to read in the gcd files in gnue-config and run the test that connects to the server and executes a method
actually neilt has a nice test too I think
"all: is it acceptable to have no method handling support built in to GEAS, or must at least one be compiled in?  code currently supports no methods (it will return errors if you try to use methods)?"
OIC
run neil_methods_test.py
to test
"hmm, hwo do you create a global variable in python that you can modify from a function?"
I thinkn configure should fail if they do not turn one on
I used the ones in examples/businessobjects/methods
for testing
ok
chillywilly:  thats correct one or the other or both are ok
"yes, at least one"
try also geas/examples/python
for tests
ok
should default be to compile in support for all method types (i.e. use --disable-methods )?
well...
what good would the server be with 0 methods?
i would agrree to default for both
"I'll reword that: should default be to compile in support for all method types (i.e. use --disable-methods-{python,glibmodule} if you don't want it compiled in#)?"
"but if you configure one, the other does not get configured"
huh?
hmmm
or that
"examples of configure options and what you would expect to happen, please?"
I'm thinking:
(no options) - support for all types
default = both
I think I like compiling all methods by default...eventually if we have language plugins we can do somethng different
(--enable-methods-python)  -- support all types
(--disable-methods-pythong) -- support all types except python
--enable-methods-python for python only
--enable-methods-glibmodule for glib only
isn't that confusing?  
If I specify --enable-methods-python I wouldn't expect it to affect glibmodule methods
or --enable-methods-python and --enable-methods-glibmodule to do the same as the default
"it would not effect glib module, it would just not compile it in"
"since --enable-methods-XXX would be new anyway, how about not including it and just having --disable-methods-XXX?"
because i hate negative configuration options
what happens when we add objective-c methods
then you have to know what to disable
to make it work
I think this needs to be written by someone who knows autoconf!  :-)
i think we should have option that turn on support for each type of methods
compile all by default
no not all
they have to disable the ones they do not want
just glib and python
ok
then those 2 by default
if we add more types of methods they are not in the default
"all by default, I think - speaking as a packager I know that it's common to not check the available option set before you compile "
the rest shoudl be --enabled?
and what's so special about python and glibmodules anyway?
chillywilly: yes
"mcb30: yes, that is what i was thinking"
we support them right now
<g>
mcb30: python is our preferred langauge and glib is our preferred C  lib
and we want to limit the number of dependencies
and I thought this would be a simple question!
in the normal install
usually you have them turn on the hariy/untested features which would be new method code for other langauges
"OK, I'm definitely leaving the configure script to someone else!"
;)
"For the purposes of coding, all I need to know is:"
yes cw or reinhard will do the configure script
"if no method types are #defined, then should:"
easy for me to say :)
a) #error to abort the build process
b) error at runtime if you try to actually use a method?
those defines checked in methods.c are fronm config.h
mcb30: b) with write to log
"ok, in which case:"
mcb30: there will always be some method support
aaargh
during the build process a strong warning should be issued
How about:
"a) #warning during build process, AND"
b) error at runtime (with write to log) whenever you attempt to use a method?
hold on
in thinking about this more
holding
mcb30: this is for the case that they --disable everything?
methods are central to the geas and gnue-config
i rethink that during config one type of methods is required
O say you can only enable and disable development method provider code
ok
can I therefore assume that the code itself does NOT need to check to see that at least one method type is defined?
make that at least one type of method is required
"glibmodule an python is not really development per se, they have been around a while and is the only thing we got"
neilt: we should just not let them even diable that one
"mcb30:  i think that is correct, you can rely on at least one type being required from configure script"
diable
bah
typing sucks
:P
OK.  I will take out the bits of the code that deal with the case of "no methods defined".  Any objections?
nope
nope
it is unnecessary
good
that makes life easier for me
and the code will be easier to read
New topic: any comments on my e-mail about dynamic methods (sent to geas list about 15 mins ago)?
back in 5 mins
yes
well I'd rahter have a meth provider factory class and load the the thing dynamically and use GObject.....but that may not happen for a while
if I can convince some ppl ;)
s/meth/method
who is dmitry?
is that you ra3vat?
ah yes it is
:P
back now
fire away
well I'd liek the ability to mix and match methods
"some in C, some in python, some in whatever langauge"
you've got that at the moment
but at the object level
meaning?
so an object acna have a method in whatever langauge and can even have other methods in another langauge
"yes, that works as of now"
ok
now I thought the scenario would be like
a method request comes in
"btw, I'm trying to read your thing on autoconf but all the links point back to the same top-level document..."
it consulta the cache
if nothing is found that implements that language it would interrogate any other plugins
and add those entries to the cache
you mean "implements that method"?
and eventually return something that can execute the method
hehe
implements the language...you load the interpreter or whatever
then you can lod the method
and execute it
might be kinda slow though
so you can use a chache or whatnot...maybe jeep the plugins loaded once executed the first time
that would be "lazy method loading" - would give faster startup but first invocation of each method would be slow
yes
exactly
jsut the ideas that I had from before
as I was supposed to redo metods
"and to force a reload, you just need to reset the cache"
:P
yea
did you read about KDE and lazy loading?
sorta like how ld works and ls.so.conf
blame neilt: he challenged me to get both python and glibmodule working at the same time yesterday! :-)
:)
well i have been too busy with this other thing and I don;t care if you work on methods
I welcome it :)
thanks
Isomer: what's that?
sure?  I don't want to tread on anyone's toes here
and I didn't know it was already planned
don't sweat it there's plenty of other fish to fry in GEAS
"we've all lost our toes, so not worry"
lol
chillywilly: KDE was having massive problems with startup times on apps because C++ required that it's virtual tables not be lazy linked
"chillywilly: Gnome was loading way <1s, KDE was taking 2 or 3s to load an app"
and 99% of that time was the fact that KDE was doing linking
where Gnome could defer it
well we use C :P
shouldn;t be a problem
precisely why Gnome didn't have the problem
"but you were discussing Lazy linking, I thought I'd drop the datapoint in :)"
uhuh
GNU Common C++'s Dso class has the same issues I think
those pesky virtual tables
"yeah well, KDE's done a lot of work and found work arounds"
I'm not entirely sure how
I think it involved improving the C++ linker
"welll I havea kick ass templatized plugin thing I stole, but we're using C so it is useless"
:(
doh!
"btw, GObject already loads ""objects"" from dsos if you use GTypeModule"
it will load new 
"types" from a dll
yay
I am repeating myself
doh
okie
if it's of interest 
gotmadlocke's code works here
"thnks him, it is great"
kewl
what does gotmadlocke's code do?
ra3vat: commit it quick!
ajmitch: it require tons of additional files as I now know
Isomer: web driver for forms
chillywilly: :)
Isomer: using webware
Excellent!
jcater: you here?
yes
tried windows install
how'd it go?
I know designer has many issues
default encoding always leave as ascii
so non ascii forms does not work
sigh
were the linux versions in CVS working for you?
and please look at this aout GetDefaultEncoding in wxPython:
http://lists.wxwindows.org/pipermail/wxpython-users/2000-October/003580.html
same problem here - GetDefaultEncoding does not exist
<jcater> were the linux versions in CVS working for you?
it require
to change something in site.py or place sitecustomize module
it's outside the code
"ra3vat: are you referring to the PostgreSQL encoding, or the Designer <?xml encoding=????> encoding?"
I assume the latter?
wow i have missed a lot :(
rtfl
:P
jcater: me eat pizza donut all day today :()
PostgresSQL encoding needed to convert data on the fly if database and client on different platform
 <?xml encoding=????>  need to start form itself
if labels non-ascii
hrm
you guys know a bout XSLT?
Isomer: oh yes :)
mdean: has become quite the master of xslt
why?
arghhhhhhhhhhhh
time for moovee be back later
sure i will miss more good conversation sigh
 <ra3vat> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~dimas/samples/forms/helloworld2_ru.gfd
poor masta
have fun masta
:)
Isomer: dont bother
really
then have the server side just do a few simple things
within week hopefully code will be in cvs
yeah
that does web forms via a gfd
I guess
no 'translation' needed
"XSLT would be good, but I don't think it fits the GFD structure very well"
fair enough
also many browser don't yet support it
which is another -'ve
ja - but the server could pick up where clients are weak for XSLT
problem I saw is that the GFD has no flow
offload the work to clients where possible they have extra cycles
Maniac: *Precisely!*
unfortunately you can't trust clients at all
Maniac: duh!  more thwaps for you!
"that's why you detect your agent - send it XSLT if it can handle it, otherwise transform on server"
then everyone is happy
yeah
unless the browser translates wrong.. buggy
simple transforms shouldn't be a problem tho
what worries me is actually using XSLT conditional processing and such
dunno. i've had weird results with both css and xsl between different browsers.
takes extra testing to make work i guess.
ja
running multiple browsers at the same time and hitting refresh constantly ;-)
what if gcd follow W3C XForms spec?
"er, gfd"
you have an Earl for that?
URL?
yep
Earl
rdean!?!  What the...!
whats the XForms spec say?
:-)
omg it's a *dean invasion
aaaah!
all your channel are belong to us
ha ha ha!
mdean: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/
hmmm - Konqueror didn't like the mozquito demo beneficiary form
konq sucks
:P
blah!
galeon forever!
i should try galeon again. netscape 6.2 and mozilla use to much memory for my parents computer and neither netscape nor konqueror get the job done.
Konqueror would be there if the JavaScript engine would work 100%
hey Michael when did you get here?
it has decent CSS support
doh
I misssed your entrance
"yea, but is there any cire for its fugly interface...i think not ;)"
cure
no cure for the QT disease
been watching here a while.. trying to follow anything i can. maybe more caffine would help.
"yes, more is better"
chillywilly: XForms seems like it would be better suited as an output than a source
i don't use javascript.. i always disable it.. so that doesn't effect my browser choice. i just find konquerer weird.. personal preference.
it is probably more about packagin up the data
could you get XSLT to convert XML to XForms?
sure
chillywilly: yeah - it's separating the UI from the data
Isomer: anything is possible ;-)
mdean: but the UI is pretty agnostic
ansd that's the point of GNUe Forms
translating one xml to another is easy
format
translating any xml format to anything else is pretty easy
xml rox
Isomer: I even have some XSLT to generate SQL scripts :)
Isomer: http://www.w3schools.com
you can learn ti all there
s/ti/it
w3schools is a bit IE oriented at times for me
hehe - "a bit" he says ;-)
"yea, but it gets the concepts across"
they are total M$ butt lickers
"most of the DOM stuff is applicable, as is CSS"
no doubt about it
the XSL stuff they had led me through hell trying to figure out why it didn't work right. lol
I just ignore most of the IE examples
:P
Ora just released an XSLT book not too long ago - it is most excellent
ignore the IE examples and you are left with "This is XSL.. and now you know XSL."
Michael: hehe
heh
well I wasn't aware that those examples were IE specific
just stupid IE examples because they have their nose up M$'s ass
a lot of the stuff translates to Mozilla/NS6 tho - if it deals with DOM or CSS1/2
IE5 and up adopted the W3C DOm
cool
cross browser scripting got a whole lot easier at that point
:P
I need to read that one
my drag-n-drop editor I wrote for work runs in IE and Mozilla
an editor in a web browser?
could probably port GNUe Designer to the web too ;-)
yessir
I was looking at doing that while ago
JavaScript?
looked far too complicated
Isomer: actually pretty simple
chillywilly: yup
or is ti ECMA script now?
s/ti/it
"lots of JavaScript - but mostly for managing object data, not the drag/drop stuff"
that part is small/easy
where's the code ;)
proprietary :-(
heretic
infidel
yeah - gotta make a living too
no one expects the GNU inquisition
rofl
Kansas City isn't exactly a hotbed of Linux jobs right now
mdean: I don't accept that bull...but I'm not getting into this
chillywilly: I know you don't - but at least I'm here off hours :-P
they didn't make you sign over rights to each and every bit of code you ever write?!?!  :P
nope
I signed an NDA - and that's it
they don't care about the side projects I do
which really amounts to just DCL
since I don't touch this stuff at work
a company I almost went to a couple years ago would have required me to sign such an agreement tho
and I was not at all comfortable with it
just say no mdean
I didn't go :)
jst say no to prorietary software too
typing is going into the shitter
*sigh*
is there any OSS speach recognition software?
OSS: does not compute
"I thought there was one such project, but I don't remember the name"
ok
fine
:P
IBM might have something too 
is there any GNU speach recognition software
IBM has ViaVoice
which they give away the linux developers kit for Free (beer)
ja - but I'm not sure if they ported it
ah
I looked at it
and ignored it
hehe
Isomer: :)
and TV remote :)
damn that is alzy
lazy even
"yeah, I'm in the programming business, it's my job to automate as much as possible"
I don't wantto get up to find the remote
rofl
heh
they give a very strong impression of being "intellegent"
even though after you've figured out how they work it's pretty stupid
i wanna make a light saber activated mp3/video plauer for my computer.. using the light saber from my interactive yoda.
o-k
where did that come from?  ;-)
oh remotes.. heh
"mp3's, furbies, etc?"
heh
i think the light saber registers motions and relays via IR what motion was made.. sort of 3d gestures.. single button remote controls :)
anyone still awake around here?
yeah
yep
ouch
:'(
crap the chill is multiplying
hmmm my logger still seems to work
suppose i should clean it up and put on ash
cool
get to it
:P
http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/17Nov2001.html

probably
"heheh, some of them aren't legitimate though"
as i said without cleanup
most of them
why am I green?
"i see lots of things like one being able to tell it whether to 'supress' openproject messages (i.e. the joins, splits, etc)"
um
i didnt have hex list
so i picked named things
red
blue
green
etc
you are techinically 'lime' iirc
oooh
heh
USERLIST = {
"    ""&lt;derek&gt;"" : ""red"","

    "&lt;chillywilly&gt;" : "lime"
           }
was the user list
lime
haha
k
i was 'playing'
yes I am sour
"mind you i wrote this at like 2 am, after the super bowl in a 8' x 8' NYC hotel room the day before LWCE"
"so if you are looking for 'logic', save yourself time and stop :)"
heheh
it is pretty cool
what do you parse things with?
it had two purposes that really killed me and two more that i wanted fixed
1. was i wanted crap to word wrap :)
derek: so why don't I see more commits from you?
2. i wanted the links to be clickable
hmm.. anyone installed webware?
and the secondary things were
on the gnue commit list
Mr_You: I believe ajmitch has
3. wanted to be able to send messages from the irc logs
its not clear how you use it
Mr_You: can i help? ;)
"4. wanted to categorize things automagically, so we could ;autoproduce; something like KC GNUe :)"
"I ran the install script, what do I do after that?"
actually the master plan was combine 3 and 4
i.e. auto categorize then send it to the email lists :)
"Mr_You: start the appserver, hack your apache config for the mod_* stuff if you use it"
lemme try remember what else
"chillywilly: its python, one of first real programs from scratch i wrote in python"
what is the appservers filename?
also first time i used regex heavily
and that part could use some help form a regex stud :)
Mr_You: usually start appserver from the webkit dir with Monitor.py
regex is like black magic
you can do some really cryptic shit with it
"wow, looks like i started categories"
so
**** is the 'switch' to tell it you are giving it a command
then you list the command
separating options with :
so
<derek> crap the chill is multiplying 
hehe
****START:GEAS
I missed that ione
will throw the category to GEAS and look fo ran
****END:GEAS
cool
and catalog all between it seperately
also starting for
same url?
****EMAIL:chilly@gnue.org
some stuff
er
****START:EMAIL:chilly@gnue.org
email him some stuff
****END:EMAIL:chilly@gnue.org
could work perhaps
that just needs to be built into the irc protocl ;)
protocol
chillywilly: btw: the idea on the categories i think at first was to create just emails to send
or generate seperate html files by the categories so say someone wanting just geas info
woudl just read geas.date.html
instead of gnue.date.html
"heh, I wonder if they just named my county on SNL"
but now i suppose it would be better to come up with an XML file
output from this
mmmmm
spaghetti
and then do an XSLT transformation :)
that is much smarter
with meat balls
and builds a nice index and such
uuuuuuuughghgjhglkjhslkfjghlksjhfglkjhdfg
later i suppose :)
i just want to make it tables first
so its
hafta check the tape on that.. hehe... funny skit

ImportError: No module named AsyncThreadedAppServer
ouch
Mr_You: hmm?
"ok, you got me on track, let me see where I get ;-)"
"Mr_You: uhh, where you starting this from?"
the AsyncThreadedAppServer.py file should be in the dir you're using
brb
its not there
hmm
what dir?
WebKit/

ok
hehe... "I had grown tired.  I had grown tired of the holligans and shinnanigans.  And even the Flannigans."

[03:18:07] < loic > Milosch: I'm working on re-implementation of Savannah (savannah.gnu.org) to use phpGroupWare as a codebase instead of the SourceForge software.
now why in the heck would anybody do that?
i'm just curious.
"cause VA Linux is evil, but why phpGW?"
I dunno though
does phpGW have the  same types of project stuff as SF?
I also heard that the SF code is a mess
"well ok, if SF code is such a mess that it's a tossup between SF and phpgw, then i'd take phpgw."
plus phpGW is a GNU Project :)
but i was just curious coz SF already scales
but that makes sense

hi all
"guten morgen, Herr Neighbors"

moin herr dean
masta d
ich bin der masta
er
ich bin der meister
hmm
I understood the second about as well as the first
"early start, derek?"
iirc 'ich bin' == i am
ja
jcater: the early coder catches the bug
you can have it
have y'all seen http://www.mosix.org/ ?
jcater: you see it works like this ...
jcater: yup - even before they GPL'd their code
the masta bird catches the bug then chews it up and spits in it in coders mouth
mdean: you used it?
jcater: it raised a big fuss in the Linux community
oh
jcater: nope - just kinda follow it once in a while
derek: do you have a visual image?
lol
of the catching or the spitting?
;)
is this generally the same as beowolf?
generally=conceptually
mmm
derek: I had another idea about the trigger language-neutral issue
derek: tho I'm think it will not be a very popular idea
jcater: you suck (wrt to fresh muffins)
i dont think it is same as beowoulf
it is same 'concept' of 'clusered linux'
but i think there are like two or three 'ways' to approach clustering
iirc beowoulf and mosix approach in different ways
but i could be wrong
also there is mission critical linux that does clustering
and i think turbolinux has some clustering stuff too
i think most of them are 'kernel' extensions
except for beowoulf (but i could be grossly mistaken)
mdean: what is that?
we live on 'non popular' ideas
"yes, we do"
it wouldn't be fun otherwise
"thus our support for J2EE, SOAP, .NET etc"
http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/
i told you my xul stories
so actually im a fairly big fan of mozilla :)
i think we could 'support spidermonkey'
"personally, I think that would kick ass - since it would make GNUe web forms triggers almost no-brainer"
but it would just be another language
"yip, I agree"
so is there no value in using a more neutral language?
what d'ya mean??
well - I mean: use spidermonkey as the language the forms triggers are written in
yes and no
the idea was to make it so each development haus wouldnt have to learn a 'new language'
so the perl house could use perl to do rules
the php house coud php to do rules etc
yes but:
you are tied to a language currently in your forms
if we were going to go with one language i would choose python over spidermonkey
and you probably don't want to embed triggers in every supported language
mdean: yes but that is short term only
our 'standard' language will be python for triggers
ok - so I'm missing the big picture then?
and our base packages will be python triggers but we want to let any language be used
and im sure some will 'convert'
so you might see say
"like wxWindows has wxGTK, wxMotif, wxMac etc"
you might see GNUe Accounting (perl)
GNUe Accounting (python)
etc
we would only concentrate on the python rules
but if someone that just loved ruby or perl or php or javascript wanted to maintain a concurrent langugage we would let them
I think that deemphasizes the value of component based apps tho
yes and no
believe me i struggle with this one a lot
i think as far as GNUe applications (from gnue) the SAP rival goes we will ONLY concentrate on python based 
BUT gnue is also a tool that you can use independently
here i see value in being able to 'choose' a language
"say i have an existing system written perl, that i have out grown"
if i had separated biz logic i might be able to reuse a good portion of my code in gnue
as well as not have curve of learning python
"sometimes when i think about it, for speed sake i think (development not execution) i think we are crazy to support more than one"
and think we just support python
and if we lose a few folks so be it
I'm just concerned about reinventing the wheel for the sake of doing it in another language
i think our stance is we will simply write the ability to couple another language
and leave it at that
GNUe core team will not focus energy on adding a bunch of languages
or 're duplicating' efforts to make sure there is a perl and php and python version of our applications
"yes, but you don't want to design yourself into a corner either (which I don't think you're doing anyway)"
which is what i think you are saying seems superflous (and with that i agree)
but some people are STUBBORN and insist on their language 
in which case if they want to spend the time rewriting all the gnue apps in their language more power to them :)
just means more choice for the user
like assembly language programmers who want their macro assembler written in assembler - pointless ;)
"it is worth adding that if someone is simply wanting to extend our packages, they wouldn't have to rewrite the base in their language"
jcater: that is true too
nothing says you cant mix and match
i.e. have base with python and add a custom trigger in perl
jcater: I realize that - I'm more concerned with having to have the appropriate platform depending on form trigger language
and doing this would be a big boost to the web side of forms
but
feh - children interrupted train of thought
"welcome back, all"
sheesh!
mdean: i think you have a point
but i think webforms will be so easy and number of people knowing javascript is limited
the UIdriver will take care of most of it
so you all ready to talk reports 
muhahahahaha
sure

ra3vat: howdy
jcater: hi

who?
derek
jcater: do I need separate driver or something to use gnuef with mysql both on windows?
you will need a mysql driver for windows
hang on... lemme see if I can find precompiled mysql drivers
ra3vat: I don't think the mysql drivers work on win32 without modification
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/mysql-python/mysql/README.windows?annotate=1.1
hi derek
just sent you an email re the reports stuff from Thu
do you want to discuss now
or go away & have a think?
(assuming you're not just logging anyway)
"jcater: oh, may be i'm missing something for pypgsql also? pgAdminII works fine, thanks mdean "
"so, pgAdminII is working on Win32??"
and you can access your postgres database?
yes
what message is forms giving you again?
the exception?
iirc there are mysql drivers for windows 'native' 
but i dont think they were tested
i think windows odbc was tested
by jade a LONG time ago so who knows status now
 jcater: hold on
and i know there are mysql odbc drivers for windows
psu: i can quasi discuss
trying to burn a few things and gettiung ready to leave
whats up
read mail and good stuff
we should discuss at diff time as it will go outside scope of my time today :)

you able to use postgres on unix?
derek - no problem
catch you later
im thinking perhaps you dont have tcp/ip enabled properly on your postgres server
"jcater: login window disappeared, I have dos window with that error and nothing happen  "
postgres has option -t at start and I have pgAdmin working
-i
from the same win machine
how does pgAdmin work
did you have to use a password with pgAdmin?
im not familiar with it
if its web based
jcater: w/o password
and the files are on your postgres server its possible that its not using tcp/ip
is your postgres server on win32 or on unix?
"derek: no, it's a win32 application"
postgres is on unix machine
and the linux machine name is ics? 
and the win machine is resolving this name?
derek: pgadmin.postgresql.org
jcater: yes
derek: we had (at mdean's suggestion) him install it on win32 to see if the win32 machine could access pgsql
bbl
jcater: will try to download source for pypgsql
"For this reason, the binary win32 versions of pyPgSQL that we provide are"
already built against the PostgreSQL 7.2 development version.
I have pgsql7.1.3
jcater: next time you can ask me to :)
i have it all configured
ra3vat: ah
never mind i read why now :)
derek: ?
i have windows clients at work talking to postgres on unix
but i see that its a 'specific version' test now
jcater: pgsql version should not be the problem
reboot number 15 for windows
dont you love when you tell an os to go down and come back up
and it just isnt capable of it
even when no hardware has been changed
16
yeah number 16 worked
jcater: test example basic.py from pypgsql source works fine from my windows machine to postgres on unix
ra3vat: what version of pypgsql did you grab?
latest
2.0
example does work
how did you run the basic.py (what was your command line)
I'm trying to see what it does differently than we do
python basic.py ics::icsinfo ds ''
can I email you a file to test out??
"first, can you /msg me with your connections file?"

Anyone can tell me what "features" make MS Access even worse than mysql toy?
I don't understand
there is Filemaker Pro for Linux now ;-
)
we're not much like mysql but even more hate Access. Why?
I still don't understand your question
oh
why is is Access so bad besides it is from MS?
well... I don't like Access because #1=M$.. and #2 I found out that it randomly loses data.. not sure how they fixed that or if they even have.. cause supposedly fixing the problem could also lose data.. not sure whatever came out of that.. it was a big deal because a lot of doctor offices use Access.. so there are big chances some doctors offices have lost data and don't even realize it
so those are my reasons.. 
"but probably the biggest reason is I just don't enjoy using M$ products, but I do require an OS on any machine and sometimes it happens to have and M$ OS on it ;-)"
but I stay away from jobs that are majority Windows-work related
"and then they are healing us, it's scary :)"
Mr_You: thanks
yeah..
well I would say that most hospitals are probably not using Access..
unless its super small
but yeah doctors heal us and their offices could be ;-)
most major hospitals have used unix servers for years I believe
l8r
see ya
Mr_You: isn't that just an Urban legend?
hmmm
"I dunno.. I'm pretty sure many places covered it, is there an info page?"
"I dunno, I really didn't follow up"
I just heard that one of the major "cases" of this was a bad 3rd party app using Access
but I really don't follow MS :)
doin a search

jamest: that you?
yip
it's me
howdy
"so, did you play w/ mcmillan any?"
I haven't GNUe'd much at all since we last spoke
ah
"well, today didn't go as planned "
I polished designer's menu a little bit
so I have a ton of homework for tomorrow
ah
I'll try and gnue later sunday afternoon or evening
ok
you worked on the menu eh?
Just a little
cleaned up a few oddities
added the Help->Do my work for me. menu option
?
no
BUT
it will tell you that you have unsaved changes if you try to Close or Exit 
:)
that's about all I've done
"well, I spent some time w/ra3vat today"
:)
I had to patch pypgsql's connect script
as it worked for you and I under windows
again?
but not for him
damn
I changed it to the host::dbname:user:pass:: format
and it worked for him
(and still worked for me too)
"in retrospect, I wonder if some of his settings files"
were not in ASCII
"and when I modified the DBdriver to do a ""%s"", it converted"
"I see no reason why old format wouldn't work and the new one would, "
but that's how it worked out
btw
I'm doing a comprehensive README.databases
(have been for last 1 1/2 hours)
lists all the drivers we support and what they expect in connections.conf
um
um?
you mean that the connect string I originally had worked?
and that the new stuff didn't?
no
not at all
so instead of user=%s
you have host::dbname:user:pass::
as the string?
yes
that's how there examples are
sigh
and he used the examples (basic.py IIRC) on his windows machine to verify it was our driver and not
some connections problem
"yes, sigh"
I spent a few hours going thru the basics
(are you sure your dbname is right? can you ping the unqualified host?)
but he was using pgAdmin on windows
so that kinda disqualified some PostgreSQL problem :)
lol
has madlocke been arround today?
nope
drat
he said yesterday he'd be back in a week
(iirc)
"well, I'll be!"
PygreSQL released 3.2
and it supports windows
"ah,"
but try and find a binary
:)
:)p
they didn't have a 3.2 binary last week
nor this week
we still want a release this weekend?
if possible
you have time?
i can make time on Sun
this README is last thing I plan on doing
cool
derek's forms passed the test
did he then retest the older forms
to make sure they still work?
I dunno
"ok, I think I'm taking off for the night"
I'm exhaused
ok
sleep well
ok
later
"yay, new weekly news!"
what's the URL again? 
I don't have it bookmarked at home yet
"ah, found it"
"psu: for future reference, my name is Jason, not Jeff :)"
hey Jeff Cater :P
doh
:D
he got your name wrong in the KC dude
"yeah, I noticed"
sigh
hmmm
later he clals you Jason
calls even
he must've been in a hurry
:P
"if anyone has time, please proof the gnue-common/README.databases file"
later
the README file proves jeff smokes crack ;)
chillywilly_: hi
hi all
hi all
bye all
bbl
anyone bored and want to play a game?
howdy all
howdy
morning
hi sevik
i know your all python fans here
"Perhaps it's just my imagination, but Python programmers seem to command a great deal more respect than their Perl or PHP counterparts."
"In the consciously-elitist world of software engineering, a developer with a few years of Python under his belt gets the best cubicle, the prettiest girl and the respect of his neighbours"
http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/Python/Python101/Python101_1/page1.html
the prettiest girls?
where can i learn python??
;)
j/k
:)
bye all
morning all
morning
gotta run!
heh
"i'm not *that* bad, am i? ;)"
ajmitch: perhaps ;)
ajmitch: forget your deodorant??
:)
hehe
i see KC GNUe #2 is out
yip
not sure if I like being quoted or not :)
sigh
now I'll have to follow through :)
heh
it has it on record as me being a volunteer for geas hacking
now that's scary (althoug i've finished uni for the year)
:)
"heh, it has you as 'Jeff Cater' in one place"
in most of the places
"in 8 sections, IIRC :("
and 'jason cater' in some places
"well, jeff/jason, what will you do about it? ;)"
I dunno
"if I don't like being quoted, maybe this is for the best :)"
hehe
"""No, I didn't say I was gonna do that; you must be thinking of Jeff"""
so just what's stopping GEAS being (safely) used in production environments? :)
heh
"beats me, I'm just a tools guy :)"
hehe
wb o jcater
thx
jcater: you here?
hey chillywilly
hey ajmitch
hey cw
nickr: hi
hi
nickr: rumour has it you have some concept of a document management system for GNUe?
i have been reading up on xml - what use do you plan to make of it?
Maniac: Rumor is correct
gemcat: xml is used heavily throughout gnue
well my question was philosophy - what are your aims?
philosophy?
i think to be successful you need a very strong database interface - are you using xml for that?
AFAIK no databases support XML transactions
MSSQL 2k does
"the database interface, and most other interfaces, are based on CORBA afaik."
there is a lot of discussion
actually there are several 'engines' that generate xml from databases
hey Isomer
the ticklish thought is what if you have a really huge set of documents
gemcat: we are doing xml _from_ database in the reports module
and we have looked at the xml query language from the gnome-db project
and we decided to stick with SQL for the db access
i am really excited about what you are doing
because SQL is sufficiently standardized
and supported natively by virtually every db
the sybase interface is sql via the java engine
one feature of that is the ability to choose what is done server side and client side
hey chillywilly
hey reinhard
btw happy birthday!
thanks :)
it was yesterday though
uh oh
but I'll accept it just the same
-)
dammn time differences
doh
i thought i read it in todays log
I got one eye
hehe
"nope, yesterday"
unless it is still Nov. 10th there
no
nickr: are these plans in the planning stage still?
but it was Nov. 11th here already when you said it was your birthday :)
IIRC
well I can't help that you are just so farahead of me
;P
nevermind :)
k
10:50 p.m.
you are 6 hours ahead
still it should've been the 10th when I said it
even by you
maybe
i read it in the logs
and there is no timestap
10am + 6 hours = 4pm
I was on IRC around that time yesterday
iirc
"well, thanks for saying it anyway :)"
stupid timezones
hey nickr
nite all
Hi.
has any there been any success recruiting from the many small enterprise related projects at sourceforge?
it looks like several could fit nicely - expecially the fundraiser and the bbs ones
I'm terribly board.
Is there a guide somewhere to building 2 teir apps with gnuef etc?
nickr: you could explain to me your plans for a doc management sytem :)
"Maniac: Sure, hmm"
The basic premise is a system in which each of three componants are intended to be operated by different entities (of course they could all be operated as one also)
hrm so theres no internal trust between the componants
"bascially there are two major elements, and a sort of combinator, there is a Metastore a Physicalstore and the DocuStore"
ok
The physical storesimply stores blocks of data under a key
like a sort of filesystem
but without any metadata
"hrmm, maybe I should go back to hov the system sees documents"
ok
It sees documents as an identifier wich is associated with several unchangeable instances
so its like a permininant versioning system
"you have, say, document Foo, and Foo has several instances, Bar, Baz and Quux which are considered to be 'versions' of Foo"
"The cananical Foo could notionally be the newest or the oldest or whatever, depending on the application build ons the system"
"Each instance may be created or destroyed or modified until it is 'committed', at which point it becomes immutable"
"so anyway, the metastore indexes and keeps track of certain metadata associated with each document"
(and each instance)
the phystore actually stores the documents themselves
"well the data associated with the metadata, which could be anything really"
the docustore is the combinator wihch talks to bothof the other major subsystems
hmm
this is the underlying layer
lots of different apps would be build on top of this system
such as an 'organic document system' which would essentially add templating
and a 'library' wich would add indexing and 'chick-in/check-out' semantics
ah
so the intention is to build something very extensible and customizable
"Yes, the overall intention is to provide a robust storage platform for document type apps"
this is in concept stage stil yes?
I have corba interface definitions for the frontend and some parts of the subsystems
I'm still thinking about authentication and such at the call level
I'd just as soon impliment it without to get it somewhere then add that later
i use Expedition for engineering document control - it is corba afaik
"sheesh, dropped there"
Heh
"nickr: essentially, though this is in beginning stages"
Maniac: Yes it has many hours of design and thoguht but vecry little implimentation :)
been there :)
I just haven't been sufficiently motivated as such.
anyone like my new name for GNOME
OSNOME - Open Source Nazi's Obnoxious Modeling Environment
I don't like it.
it fits
Miguel is the OS nazi
 /nick jcBusy
how much do you use php?
I use php all the itme
chillywilly: what makes miguel the OS nazi?
php has it's uses
nickr: i am starting to learn this stuff - i think windows is going for a big crash
maybe so
grr
connection trouble night
nope
probably just a golden marmoset
I closed xchat
you ever use GnuCash?
Yea
"I am trying to figure out how to enter shit in it...i.e., setup the transactions and correct tranfers of money"
I used to use it when I actually had money flow
heheh
sucks to be poor eh?
yea
"not what I want to do, but it is some money"
Its pretty easy to use
ok
say you got a pay check and yu deposti it get some cash back ans then transfer some money into anotheer account....3 transactions which should have 6 entries right?
"no, I think you just have it transfer from one account to the other, its one transation"
"Icome->checking, checking->cash, checking->other account"
Income
wouldn't that be the right way?
sure
dres was trying to help me out in #gnucash earlier but he has since disappeared
"heh, hi Remosi :)"
mornin' all
hi
nite
more KC goodness
yep
"tastier, crunchier, & better than ever :)"
and less than 10% of the fat of other leading brands!
"I actually like the GNUe KC, it's got a lot of good detai"
"yeah, he's doing a damned good job"
It's also a little disconcerting seeing what you've said
then pondering what else you're going to find in there
yeah
"he put in the bit about me volunteering, dammit"
makes it hard for me to back out of it ;)
rofl
argh!  the sarcasm bites me!  it says I suggested using mysql :-(
haha
i take it you don't like mysql? ;)
I don't know any people that do
ummmm...no ;-)
"well, people with little db background like it alot"
they have yet to be enlightened
hehe
mdean: what about simpler web-based stuff?
"well, can you point me to good and new postgresql binary for windows, then?"
ra3vat: install cygwin - I read pgsql is part of the install now
ajmitch: pgsql 100%
mdean: k
was just chatting to a friend:
"[14:07:23] <ajmitch> btw, what database do you prefer?"
"[14:07:48] <crypt> for what I do, mysql."
[14:08:05] <crypt> it is simple fast and liteweight.
mdean: thanks
ajmitch: I prefer pgsql because I care about my data ;-)
ra3vat: np
mdean: fair enough ;)
hmm
you should store your forms in the database :)
"yeah, why not? ;)"
doowap
then you don't have to distribute your app
you just distribute the ability to access the data the apps using
:)
quiet in here today :)
Remosi: we do plan on eventually providing the option of storing in the database
"Right now, though, forms can be accessed via URIs"
so you can host your forms definitions behind a webserver
ah neat
thats convenient
didn't stay long did he?
thats kinda funky
yeah
masta!
darek
hello ajmitch
piss and moan
how do you do autojoins in xchat?
in the err
i figured it out once and have #gnuenterprise automagically
in the server window
"server window, theres a place to put the channels you want to join"
"but i saw chilly said you could do , to do more than one"
now i cant fine it :)
separate multiple channels with commas
er find even
"xchat, server list"
tick show channels option
ok thats wehre i went
but i dont see ti
?
ok clicked that
the tick
but it didnt show me anything new
select the server you want (eg irc.openprojects.net)
do bart i think i see it
and then in the text box at the bottom of the window enter the channels
i cant enter anything there :(
nevermind
tis there now
you have to go into the channel edit screen
yea
"ah well, hit edit ;)"
no offense but that is bad ui design :)
hehe
rofl
"I'm not offended, but I think fixing it would be better than complaining :)"
telnet -- the one true IRC client :)
Remosi: whistling down the phone - the one true way to connect to your isp ;)
nickr: yes but unfortunately its C and Glade
that makes it even easier to fix
the glade part
and that is 'appealing' to enhance as having open heart surgery w/o numbing medication or sedation
sorry glade/c for visual ui design is shit
"ajmitch: been there, done that :)"
hehe :)
derek: 'sup dawg
su jcBusy
sup
brb testing login
forgot i was cooking and had to run to tend to dinner ):
sweet much better
thank you all :)
"btw: i found that you can do a 'shell tab in xchat', kind of cool "
anyone willing to give nfs lessons?
or lessons of samba to samba on unix boxes?
read up on /etc/exports - nfs is very simple to get going
derek: what's wrong with your sneakernet?
showing its age?
there's a decent nfs howto
yeah - man exports ;-)
worked for slack 3.0 anyway
whilst watching x-files
i like the checkin comment "VERY VERY broken work in progress" :)
ok
i will check it out
need to buy a new pc
"reinstall laptop, new pc and old pc"
then redo my server :)
slowly over time while moving ot wireless network :)
good thing is wife has approved it all
just a time thing
but my mp3 collection is out growing disk space on laptop
slowly archive things off to server
but in process of burning cds from cds (i.e. making copies for the car) which will soon be illegal (sigh)
and making them to mp3's in the process so i can take to work
all PERFECTLY LEGAL usage rights
soon to be lost ... :(
i started listening to POD via 'loaned' mp3
and subsequently was going to buy album
but now im thinking of just getting the album digitally and mailing a check to the band
new POD?
but have no idea how that would work
POD == Payable On Death
ja - the new one?
they are a San Diego Band that finally made it. :)
new one is good - much better than older stuff
i like it all :)
did anyone get to look at my README.databases
"as long as it says ""MySQL is #1"", it's ok ;-)"
don't let psu hear you :)
really - I'll have to start sending XML sarcasm fragments around 80% of my statements
mdean: rofl
any sysadmins here?
with ls
i can do ls -lh to get size in human form
and ls -lhR to get size in human form recursively
but how do i get TOTAL size?
i.e. if i do ls -lh
du
du -sh *
how do i get it to tell me size of all files in the ls as well as indvidually
or du -sh .
du -h *
sweet
danke
"gulp, my 'trimmed down' mp3 directory tree sits at 1 gig"
thanks for the du knowledge 
np :)
at work we've got a 40g drive for "stuff"
mostly ogg's/mp3's
ok new rule
mdean and jcater cant work on same days
produces too many cvs commit mails
;)
rofl
heh
"errr - and I had to trim out 3 of them for size , so you missed out on more :)"
derek: mdean did that over a lunch break
well we have GNUe developer on payroll now i believe
payroll?
funky!
ra3vat: did lithuania used to be part of russia?
i.e. to lithuania's speak russian in general?
not part not
speak i think if not forget already
 not part now
ok well scoop is we have some one graciously paying a developer
to work on gnue in lithuania now
"he speaks english well, but i figured if they spoke russian as well it would be of big help to you and him both :)"
cool
and if anyone see sevik tell him about another one from ukraine
his name is Alex Igevsky iae at nikopol.usb.dp.ua
he is behind the firewall so can't to join in here
ah ok
hmm
ra3vat: whom do you work for (if you dont mind me asking)?
you'd be suprised how easy it is to get through firewalls onto IRC :)
is it a large company? or you own your own software house
small own in my case
"hmmm, i have a friend that is looking to invest in software firms in russia and old russian states"
"if you are interested in possibly getting invested in, let me know and i will see if he is interested and have him contact you"
derek: want to loose the friend?
j/k
:)
derek: I'm interested in being financed
derek: interesting
:)
I'll take money
heh
hehe
"well, I don't know Russian, but I like Russian Vodka"
does that count?
and you'd like to be financed for vodka? :)
jcater: you here?
l8r
dumdedum
hey
heya
doodoo deee dah
wtf is this?
singin our
\hour
bah
cannot type
must get caffffieene;le;lkne;lkh
hmm
yea
hehe
I'm ok now
I got some pepsi
it's all good now
*sigh*
no reply back?
not since he said he was getting back on the 4th.. jamest emailed
"bah, just start hacking ;)"
it would decrease my learning curve
hack hack
"seems to respond to email, so I'll talk with james again and maybe hopefully get him to send us something, if not then I'll be on my own I guess :-("
can't be too hard to learn the form ui system and how to add a plugin
there's a couple examples ;)
wxwinders and curses
it is considering I don't consider myself a coder ;-)
do you know python?
nope
but I can hack heh
a little
is this like a 'where's waldo' book?
??
"derek, please forgive me"
you never heard of where's waldo?
og course
of course
you had me worried for a second
why?
chilly's gonna be pissed in the morming
?
I replied to his email
that's what the 
uh oh
"derek, please forgive me"
was about
don't get me wrong... I see where he's coming from
no problem
btw: you missed the key point :)
think it is extremely shitty that a GNU project would require me to
install non-free software in order to read and modify the documentation.
is a NON TRUE statement
"since the docs are distributed in html, ps, pdf etc they are READABLE by MANY non free tools"
since the output is latex
the modification is a lie too :)
yes
one could edit the files in emacs just fine and produce diffs etc
"well, the last paragraph alluded to your first point"
actuall jamest and I told him that this morning
now its a bit more DIFFICULT than if they had lyx but not impossible :)
"that email just really, really, REALLY pissed jamest and I off"
it's one thing to bitch and moan in IRC
but that was unnecessary
"agree, we all have our bad days"
reinhard: howdy
hey jcater
you still up?
not for too long
Is anyone here awake and listening?
yes
Excellent.  I'm trying to get a CVS copy of GNUe up and running for the first(ish) time - do you mind if I ask for a few hints?
shoot away :)
btw what exactly are you trying to run?
as "GNUe" as a whole doesen't exist (yet)
GNUe is a meta-project (a group of related projects)
"OK - what I want to do is get *something* running so I can get a feel for what there is, what state of development it's in etc. - I'd like to contribute but I need to know what already exists first!"
ok cool
let me give you a quick overview
I have finally (about 5 minutes ago) managed to get "setup.py devel" to work properly - there are 2 bugs in it
ok
we regard two major areas
1. architectur
1. architecture
1.1 GNUe Forms (ready to use)
1.2 GNUe Reports (i think very near usability)
1.3 GNUe Designer (usable
1.4 GEAS (Application Server) (not yet usable in production)
"2. applications (accounting, crm,....): all in planning state"
which setup.py are you looking at?
top-level
It references .cvsdeveldir instead of .cvsdevelbase
and then doesn't cd into .cvsdevelbase/gnue before creating the symlinks
so the links all point to the wrong place
I've got a patch file - who should I send it to?  jcater?
jcater or jamest
"ok, will do, thanks"
mcb30: btw sorry if i tell you things you already know :)
don't worry - I'd rather be told twice than not at all! :-)
people appearing here in IRC sometimes have _very_ different levels of information :)
"this is probably a stupid question and you can tell me to rtfm if you want, but what's the differnce between running with and without GEAS?"
the most important difference is
running without geas works
running with geas doesn't
:)
(yet)
running w/o geas == 2-tier == all "intellingence" is in the client
where do business objects fit in to all this?
for example the rules how to compute the tax of an item in an invoice would be run on the client
with geas = n-tier == these rules are in the "middle" tier
business objects are like "intelligent" database tables
not only data but also methods
"a business object ""invoice"" could have fields ""customer"", ""send_to"", ""bill_to"", .. etc"
so do business objects exist only within GEAS?
which are mapped to db fields
yes
and forms/reports access the business objects instead of the db
"I thought so, but wasn't sure"
ok
you don't have business objects in 2-tier mode
"so, given that business objects sound like a good idea to me, just how unstable is GEAS?"
um
geas is sloooooowwwwww at the moment
slow I can live with
the idl api is too complicated and we expect to change it
to make it simpler == better usable
a method with a bug can make the whole server crash
and worst of all
the driver for forms/reports to access geas is not finished yet
but that last one is high on the todo list form jamest and jcater
s/form/of/
reinhard: sorry about the delay: got a phone call from someone who never stops talking.  Are you still there?
mcb30: i am here again
but only for 10 minutes
ok - just wanted to say that the change you made to gnue-config/test/gcd_pass_test.gcd (changing syntax to WHERE) has broken the parser in GEAS - any idea where I should look to see how to fix this?
mcb30: yes for nw
now
you can remove that file
imho
because it's nothing more than a test for the parser
the objects defined there aren't used in any of the samples IIRC
ok
thanks
"btw, I have now got GNUe Forms talking to GEAS and I see what you mean about sloooooooooooow!"
is it debug code that's slowing it down?  it seems to be spitting out hundreds of "GEAS.ObjectList instance at 0xXXXXXXX" messages
no it's not debug code
it's a bad concept
geas works with temporary tables when building up queries
which results in a situation like
for a query like SELECT FOO WHERE X = 1
geas issues 37 (gasp!) SQL commands to the database
(psu: please keep this secret... i'm too ashamed to make that public)
we must change that concept
I don't think that's the problem area: my speed problem appears when I'm not issuing queries but just trying to enter a record
== we must rewrite that part
it takes about 2/3 seconds per *character*
uh
that is maybe the "in the works" geas driver
that is no geas problem imho but a forms problem
i expect jamest to pop up here within the next 2 hours anyway
"ok.  what's the easiest way to talk directly to geas, in the same way that I could use psql to talk directly to a postgres DB"
look at examples/python/addrbook.py
"excellent, thanks!"
will have a play around
mcb30: i will have to thank you
mcb30: we are happy if you are going to help us
gotta leave now
bbl (in 7 hours)
gbad
jamest!
morning
hi
hi again
wb
wow jcater we must be on same schedule :)
derek: you're just affraid we switched to 3rd shift to avoid you
jamest rofl
anyone here on the gnucash list?
nope
i had a thread going with a fellow making gnucash into quickbooks
i.e. adding invoicing etc
seems he is unemployed and has lots of time on his hands
he just sent a major patch
that brings gnucash a TON of new functionality
crap
hire him
ToyMan unfortunately like most of the other gnucash team
our philosphies dont quite mesh
i think there is a big difference between achieving a quickbooks clone and trying to provide easily adaptable business software
there is plenty of room for both
but the mindset is pretty different wrt approach for the two 
if that makes sense
"makes sense to me.   hi all, btw"
hi
jamest: off a discussion elsewhere
"Is when people casually mention that ""oh, no I don't use XYZ, it's got ABC bug"", that they *haven't even bothered reporting*. It drives me crazy, and should be grounds for invoking the Remote Strangulation Protocol. "
"yeah, just kidding"
I thought you might be interested in downloading the RSP :)
try reporting a ximmian bug..
i gave it about 5-6 shots and gave up
ToyMan they cant handle me (ximian)
i downloaded the first 5 releases of ximian used for 10 minutes
each time and had like a list so i stopped using
i would politely go on #evolution and submit them
"well, i like some of thier apps"
fejj was VERY cordial and good at patching things quickly
everyone else sucked
"evol, gnumeric"
but the desktop sucked
"most said use bugzilla, use bugzilla"
thier bugzilla is a NIGHTMARE
and was a nightmare to use with debian
apt-get break everything...
so my bug reporting with them was 50/50
if i talked to fejj it was good experience else it sucked :)
heh 2 nightmares
but ultimately one night they broke the build on a release and didnt SAY it broke things
and i was without mail for like 3 hours
and my options where compile from source or use another mail program
i was on deadline for a client and the crap was in my mail spool
(attachment not just text)
so i converted back to mozilla
and i really like it
more features and more stable and better looking (imho)
i'm doing an evol install in the bg as I work...
though no tasks or calendar
i do galeon and konq for browsing
i hear evolution is much better now though
probably worth trying
it is
lots of depends
ToyMan dont you know
if you run rh 7.2 with ximian desktop there are NO dependencies
so quit whining and upgrade man
mozilla is too slow
heh
btw: i got that line almost verbatim installing a POPULAR gnome package
i was told running such archaic things was my problem
i didnt tell them i had a dec alpha machine still on rh5.2 or they might have laughed me out of the irc channel :)
all bsd now
is anyone here familiar with the business object methods code in geas?
somewhat
"I'm playing with GNUe (GEAS in particular) for the first time.  I've got it all set up and running, and now I'm wondering why I can only choose to have python *or* C methods (the --enable-methods switch to configure) although the code looks as though it is designed to support both simultaneously"
any explanation?
mcb30:  you have a question about business object method code?
I am the one that made it work the last time around
"yes: in methods.c it looks as though the design allows for both python and C methods simultaneously, but the configure script only allows to select one. Is this a bug in the configure script or is there a genuine reason why only one method type can be compiled in?"
mcb30:  correct observation
the deisgn goal is for both to be available
but originally only one could be used
"we are starting to add the code for both, but it is not finished and does not work, hence its not in the configuration yet"
"ok, thanks"
so today you must select one type of method support for geas
"if you want to finish the integrated support, we would happyly accept the help"
I'll give it a try if you tell me where to start
"teh major component missing the the ability to detect at runtime where to find the method, C or python"
1) we need a catalog of C methods built at startup
2) we need a catalog of python methods built at startup
3) we need logic inserted into the methods dispatching code to determine which style of methods to use
4) we need to determine how to handle duplicate method names in c and python
"we do not have a design document for this, so other than that I cant help much"
"cillywilly was going to re-design all of the method code, but he has other priorities right now"
the other person to talk to is reinhard
he and I have the most involved in the code
ok - it looks at first glance as though most of methods.c already supports multiple methods and it's just the dispatcher (execute_method) that needs to be told where to find them.  Is this correct?
that should be close
"i know that both methods type are supposed to work, I have only personally tested the python version"
there may be one outstanding issues with the c methods
that is that fully qualified names were not working
that was the last change to the python methods code
"how about if we call the first method type, then call the second if the first returns ""cannot find method"", and only report the ""cannot find method"" error if the second method type also reports it?  is this likely to work?"
"should, there might be performance issues, but we can sort that out later"
"With the python methods, is it permitted to modify the python code while GEAS is running or not?"
"you can modify the code, but geas wont recongize it"
it loads all methods into python at startup
ok
that was one of the things being discussed when andrew was still around
'dynamically loading' methods
as there were a few approaches
1. that you place the new code out there and next time its called new code is used
2. that you place the new code out there and at set intervals all new code is loaded
3. that you place the new code out there and its not loaded until you specifically tell it to load new code
i think all 3 have value
well 1 has minimal value
1 has value for people writing methods and wanting to debug them
basically because you wouldnt want place 5 new method files out and have a process half done
true
calling new methods in the second half of a process expecting data in regards to the first half of process with old methods
very dangerous :)
the idea behind 2 is that you can do a 'scheduled upgrade' where you put the files out and say at 1:00 kick all users out and load all new methods
the idea behind 3 is the debugging idea
"i've looked at the method dispatch code and AFAICT there would be minimal performance impact from adopting the ""try both, see if one succeeds"" strategy compared to the current implementation"
so you can say ok i want to test this method so LOAD just this method
or LOAD all new methods
because it currently works by doing string comparisons against all known methods anyway...
btw: for now i think its ok to have to restart server as we are still a YOUNG app server
restarting server is a pain for developing the methods though
"mcb30 NO ARGUMENT THERE . :), just when i see bang for buck"
i would rather see a more robust server to start 
though if you are willing ot tackle the issues behind loading methods i would love it :")
i think the best way to start is method 3
which means it doesnt AUTO load methods (thusly minimal risk)
"agreed, since 2 is a special case of 3 anyway"
but you can LOAD on demand
"and if you wanted 2, just use cron + 3 :)"
it might not even be that hard to do
"i think we should make small steps, and being able to use two different types of methods is more important than how we start up.  In the long run i agree with derek."
but i will let yo ube the judge of that :)
neilt: i tend to agree
"but there is valid point that often i dont play with geas for long, because starting and stopping it is irrating :)"
then why stop it?
"sure, and the work in getting both types of method simultaneously would give me some ideas for how to do dynamic loading later"
if I'm going to actually do some coding then I need CVS access - how do I arrange this?
i think it will somewhat easy to get dynamic loading of methods (at least forpython)
cool
-
 i think it will somewhat easy to get dynamic loading of methods (at least forpython)
but lets get methods working first
not sure if you mean dynamic as not restarting or dynamic as 1 dynamic
and the goal is definatly to have dynamic methods
"1 dynamic seems dangerous to me in a functioning system, wouldnt mind it as an 'option' but not as the standard :)"
i meant that if you change the methods source is is active on the next method call
ouch that is number 1
i would be leary to make that a default
what is the difference
no problem w/ it being an option but not the defualt
control
of course you are right
if i change how something works in a complex system
that has 'steps' or 'flow'
and i update all the files
some transactions could be mid 'flow'
and so producing 'steps' that are half old code half new code
which could be dangerous :)
if i put on a timer or manually do it
then i can assure more closely that i have good timing
damn netsplits!
did anything happen in the last ten minutes (since I asked about CVS access)?
it will be an option
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.16Nov2001
yes i think its a good option
because as i developer i would use :)
just not in production
mcb30 CVS access or even submitting patches requires assignment/disclaimer of copyright to Free Software Foundation
some stuff was missed in the log
so i am going to repost
as we want to assure that the GNUe code tree is ensured to remain GPL and doesnt suffer from copyright issues like other major projects have

i thought you guys turned off flood protectino for me
does openprojects.net normally split this frequently?
depends on the day i think
normally no
bbl
welcome back all
again
this is fast approaching an unusable IRC server :-(
"in the midst of all this, can someone tell me how I go about doing the necessary steps to get CVS access (copyright assignment or whatever)?"
well first you need the software i presume thats in order :))))))))
mcb30: send me an email to jcater@gnue.org and I will reply with the first steps of copyright assignment
"mcb30: also, is there any possibility your employer might have any rights over your work"
"(i.e., will you be working on this at your job?)"
(or some other contractual obligations)
hello madlocke
hi ra3vat...
mcb30 you can also send to info@gnue.org so have your email and we can send you the documents to get started
dont let it hold up you doing work
we just cant put into the cvs tree until we get things squared away
my employer is not a problem since I run the company
lol
jcater: will send mail to you and info@gnue.org
bbl (another Simpsons episode is starting)
"mcb30 is a guy with taste, likes gnue and the simpsons :)"
no telling for taste 8-)
hey
hows it going?
did some changes to uiwebware...
still don't have my better connection :((( but people promised that I will get everything tomorrow...
you have webware installed?
me? no
been working on next release
hm... you'll need it if you want to look at my work...
i know
want of the biggest problems I had was (it was possible to solve it in UIwebware but in an ugly way)
the way of how the widgets are created
for wxpython it is ok to create a widget and then the next
for html output it is difficult because of start and end tags...
"I need something like begin create, create, end create"
hope you understand...
ok
bbl
jamest: you have some time on monday and can install webware until this time?
madlocke: i got webware here :)
and here
i think a few ppl have it
i can make an attempt to 
ok
ajmitch: so you want to try some things?
ra3vat: you too?
madlocke: sure
what version of webware does it require?
madlocke: sure
ajmitch:i am using 0.5.1 rc 1
ajmitch: but I think an older version should be possible too
webware is like up to 0.6.2b iirc
"ok, i'm using about 0.5x iirc"
maniac: then I have to look at features of new version... understand... maybe something interesting...
"madlocke, did you get your assignment turned in?"
dneighbo: ?
copyright assignment for GNUe to the Free Software Foundation?
"dneighbo: yes, long ago"
jamest: and FSF has them recorded?
IIRC yes
I'm 99% sure
"was thinking madlocke was one, but i very easily could be mistaken :)"
dneighbo: I did send it...
ok if you sent it you are probably covered :)
nevermind my blithering :)
"no problem, we're used to it"
:)
heh
"madlocke: ok, what do you want ra3vat & I to try out?"
at the moment I send some files to ra3vat ... wait...
hey psu when is next KC GNUe scheduled?
are they weekly or on a certain day
or just when you have enough information to make them usefull?
jamest: any chance of doing a branch somewhere in cvs or something
to put the webware stuff?
"madlocke: no probs, i'll just catch up on my mounds of email :)"
so its not just file sending all around?
do we have a live demo site somewhere?
"ajmitch: you email address is somewhere on the gnue website, isn't it?"
if not maybe we can setup ash to use the UIWebWare so we can it in action w/o installing it
madlocke: doubtful :) ajmitch@freedevelopers.net
dneighbo: no brank
brach
branch
once we release then we branch 0.1.x
and ui stuff goes in head
"madlocke: if you dont' mind me asking, what are you doing with webware with respect to gnue"
ok
madlocke maybe best for now to give to jamest in tarball
and he can pu tin his user dir on gnuenterprise
this way you dont have to upload every time
maniac: I use some features of webware and then make gnuef output html pages...
madlocke: cool
how are you doing record traversal?
gnuef?
you making it 'refresh' everytime you change records?
gnuef==gnue forms
jcater: you alive? dead? mauled? userfied? 
dneighbo: I am just exchanging data between html and the gnuef widgets... so no big change in the handling...
i guess ill have to see it
to understand
I will be back on monday... hope I will have my permanent internet connection then...
do you have a public version available
then I can stay longer
ok
"see you monday, have good weekend"
thx... for you too...
cu
dneighbo: latest reports from the trenches have jcater userfied
rofl
"long subjection to userfication have been know to lead to persecution, execution and crucifiction :)"
hopefully he will fair better than most
hehe
hmm a geas bug report rolls in
bbl
this is odd
forms runs on older solaris again but gives this error
Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed: error 28 (No space left on device)
now jamest
is solaris an approved gnu machine?
jamest: please excuse the silly question
you sure that no disk volume is full on that machine?
I think that's shared memory space that's filling up
uggh
this remote connection is broke
ok
btw ash is down
I really would like to begin checking it out
or at least doesn't respond to pings
oh
up again
"forget it, must have been temporary"
whew
hehe
"reinhard: yeah I've been having connectivity issues also, dunno where they might lie"
wow
good discussion about methods today
you think we found a new victim^H^H^H^H^H^Hvolunteer?
btw i am amazed how neilt can always jump into IRC just in the second he is needed :)
victim?!!!!!!!
uh you're still here??
"btw, I seem to have found a problem with the python method dispatch"
:)
when I have two method files (addrbook.geas.py and test.geas.py) it will always invoke the method in addrbook.geas.py...?
although it does the syntax checking according to the correct method
"am trawling through the code now, which is great fun since I never use C (I prefer languages where you can do a string comparison in less than 10 lines of code! :-p  ("
heh
mcb30: please don't take this code as "typical" C code :)
mcb30: what reinhard means is "it's not his fault!" :)
lol
mcb30: you talking about this block of code?
      if (!g_strcasecmp
"          (((provider_t *) list->data)->classname,"
"           g_strdelimit (obj->classname, "":"", '_'))"
"          && !g_strcasecmp (((provider_t *) list->data)->methodname,"
                            methodname))
that looks like the one
"the one for the C methods is more elegant, AFAICT"
"reinhard: for method declarations in *.geas.py files, should they be of the form ""person_tell_children"" or ""addressbook__person_tell_children""?"
i _think_ the latter
but that was the last thing neilt did and i didn't look since then
at least it _should_ be the latter
or something to that effect
every module should have its own namespace.
"ok, seems to work better with being the latter"
cool
this is scary
you seem to understand that code better after 6 hours
as i do after 6 months
:)
reinhard: maybe mcb30 is another jcater class AI
"btw mcb30: sorry for being curious, but may i ask how you heard about our project?"
"jamest: would be good, AI distribution is unfair currently ;)"
lets hope this one is powered by doughnuts like the current one
dneighbo: proposal for a new poll on the homepage: how did you hear about gnue? a) gnu homepage b) freedevelopers c) kernel cousins ...
d) bathroom wall
I run a small Linux business providing computers to UK schools and managing them.  It's been nagging at me for a while that my accounts are on paper (sometimes not even there! :-) so I spent ages looking for accounting packages
e) "the voices" told me
then I came across GNUe and was impressed by the potential scope of the project and the level of attention to detail in the docs
wow
I think I probably found it via Freshmeat - that's where I normally start searching for things
now again congrats to jamest and jcater
i hear this very often that people looking at gnue are impressed by the docs :)
"and of course also to neilt, sorry :)"
docs and screenshots - it's the quickest way to evalulate software when you've got to pick one out of many
bbl gotta watch the news on tv
Think I may have found what's going wrong with the python method dispatch: test.geas.py doesn't have a "module" declaration
"yep, that was it"
cool beans
someone get him a doughnut
jamest: you give jasons donuts to someone else you might be pulling back a stump instead of a hand in the future :)
mmm
donuts
heading home be back later
"ok, can someone explain to me what should happen if I do :"
l = odl_tree_list_classes (all_classes)
"c = odl_find_class ( all_classes, l->data, NULL)"
then what is the difference between evaluating:
odl_mangle_qualified_name ( l->data )
and
"g_strdup_printf (""%s__%s"", ( odl_class_get_parent(c))->name, odl_class_get_name(c))"
?
mcb30: the people in the know would be reinhard and neilt 
mcb30: the rest of us are not much help in GEAS I'm afraid
ok
mcb30: did you submit the python patches too?
"haven't submitted any patches yet, except for two mini-patches that (I think) I e-mailed to you and jcater earlier today"
those the ones
thanks
you think you'll be using pieces of GNUe and submitting patches alot?
yes
i'm aiming to run the business on it :-)
"currently only two employees, so it's not a huge problem if information goes missing"
mcb30: re difference: both should be identical for the special case where we have on nesting level of classes in one nesting level of modules (and we meanwhile declared this special case as the only valid case).
earlier you could have nested modules
"so if I standardise on using odl_mangle_qualified_name ( l->data ), is this a good choice?"
basically yes _but_:
all functions starting with odl are from the parser library
which is being rewritten at the very moment
and will be replaced by completely new code within the next 1-2 weeks (i hope)
and for example if you would want to take care of the method stuff
you could make wishes to that api
like you want a simple function get_functionname (method *m);
ok
"don't have any requests yet, but I'll bear it in mind"
i would like to encapsulate all that mangling in the parser library
"and have functions that return the ready-to-use function name, db field name, db table name etc."
sounds sensible
yo
mcb30 if you want to take a look at the new code its in geas/src/classdef
also i have made some thoughts about coding style and would like to hear your comments on that part of the code
"(whether it's understandable, maintainable etc...)"
chillywilly: hi
-chillywilly- TIME Fri Nov 16 15:47:46
you are up early today?
?
j/k
how is that early?
"reinhard: am in the middle of playing around with methods.c and friends atm, but will look at classdef later"
I was at work all day
I got up at 6am
well i guess that ppl that hack until 4 a.m. must sleep until 4 p.m. :)
at least i would have to :)
i went to bed at 10pm last night
I was too tired
mcb30: that's ok
btw until we have cvs access for mcb30
******************
i think best is we consider the geas/src/methods directory "locked by mcb"
******************
so we don't have to merge afterwards
eh?
"there aren't many people hacking on geas currently, anyway"
chillywilly: you might want to read the logs
that requires work :P
"ok, maybe if I feel a bit less lazy later on"
I'll read them
chillywilly: ok so in a nutshell: mcb30 is looking at our methods code as we speak :)
ok
s/looking at/improving in high speed/
what about going to GObject fellas....Gnome 2 API is ready
glib 2.0
it does not mean it will be gnome-dependant ;)
no only glib 2.0
but we need a much more OO design of things
what advantages will the user have from that?
and we get signals and slots and loading of object from libs
run time type checking
reinhard: it saves chillywilly having to implement this stuff himself ;)
and no stinking X dependencies
unlike GtkObject
"we gte inheritance too, and thread safety"
and the new ORbit is also thread safe now
a/gte/get
hey ra3vat
get the webware stuff?
not that  have a burning desire to do multi-threading as it is kicking my ass right now :(
now what are the issues of becoming glib 2.0 dependent?
but a multi-threaded app server would be cool
"umm, dependencies on glib 2.0 :)"
it's a fairly small library
jcater: really othing more than what we have now....just a newer glib
nothing
ajmitch: will try now
ra3vat: you got the stuff from madlocke tho?
jcater: a version of a library that is not included in most current packages
(read has to be installed by hand)
reinhard: that's what --prefix is for ;)
and a stable version is not yet released :)
but since no GNUe stuff is at 1.x i don't think that matters :)
they have released the environment
yes
plus the potential disadvantage that it's not ported to as many platforms as glib 1.2 (this is only a guess though)
the programmer's release
reinhard: I don't think we wil loose any protability
reinhard: it's portable
anybody knows on how many platforms 1.2 works?
not off hand
and 2.0?
why would they make it any worse?
look at glibc
1.* run on tons of platforms
2.* runs on linux period.
"(and i mean linux here, not gnu/linux) :)"
portability is supposed to be one of the main goals of glib
ajmitch: yes and sent it where i am now. checking
reinhard: eh?
reinhard: glib is not at the kernel level :P
i am just overcautious maybe
reinhard: that's not a bad thing!
lately i see such a ton of projects being killed by their dependencies
reinhard: we already depend on glib
not only that dependencies increase the work to do when installing a software
so what dependency are we adding?
but also they can break portability
glib hasn't changed in dependencies....it's the same old glib but with a nice X-free object system
we would be adding the dependency for 2.0
which is something different that 1.2
ajmitch: some group from new zealand will give concert tomorrow :)
ra3vat: oh?
whatever dude I am gonna be writing some code using GObject and no one can stop me
:)
you know which group? 
"chillywilly: shoot right off, it's fun :)"
2.0 fixes what is fscked up with most gnome programs
chillywilly: i already did (for gnome-db)
reinhard: no reason to do that with glib it doesn;t have the same problems as gnome-db
"ajmitch: no, just heart from a friend"
"ajmitch: crowded house is nz, right?"
reinhard: yep
doesn depend on X or bonobo or anything...in fact glib only needs glibc...which everything needs
:)
is glibc too much of a dependency for us?
maybe we should implement our own?
;P
well
you joke
ajmitch: where are you in nz?
but that does limit the portability
chillywilly: i meant i already used gobject
ra3vat: down south in dunedin
chillywilly: and serously i don't want to depend on glibc
chillywilly: does glib truly depend on glibc?
chillywilly: geas must work with every libc
reinhard: i think glib does
ajmitch: I don't think so
that is posix compatible or near that
ajmitch: the whole point is to be portable
brb
ajmitch: so I was wrong in saying that
in fact even the Thread class will run o win32
s/o/on
um yes that is the feeling that i actually have
that glib cares a lot about portability between linux-based systems and win32
but not so much about portability to other un*x systems
well lemme look and see exactly what systems it will compile on and work
but i can't tell for sure
I have the code here
however
every dependency is a disadvantage per defintion
"and it can be an advantage, too"
and we have to check what overweights
"I know this, what is your point?"
so i asked what the advantage is
i mean the advantage for the user
and I told you
it is for us mainly...I am not doing my own OO glue crap in C and yes I like programming with objects
oh
hi all
well i think more about the user than about us
hi psu
derek asked about the KC frequency earlier
(I have spies everywhere)
lol
reinhard: if I can reuse code with inheritance and develop faster than the user wins too
"ok, I have spies at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.16Nov2001"
frequency is weekly
just sent a new one to Zack
I try to send by Saturday
covering up to previous Wed
(this is to reflect KC's standard rule 
of don't summarise threads less than 3 days old
"less of an issue for IRC, really"
but gives me a couple of days to get things sorted 
so fine by me ;-)
chillywilly: you think the difference between code reuse via inheritance and code reuse via functions is really big?
"Once the next issue is up, I will post to gnuenterprise.org ""portal"""
and to gnue-discuss
(please note the grammar:
"this is a question, not a negation! :)"
"actually, Zack has now set up a couple of mailing lists"
reinhard: ?
kcgnueannounce & kcgnuedistrib 
at http://kt.zork.net/lists.html
so I will promote these too
chillywilly: i am trying to see the world throught mr. lazy accountant's eyes
if i were an accountant
Tempting as it is to subscribe gnue-discuss to at least kcgnueannounce
and you were the coder
what would i want you to do?
I suspect subscribing one mailing list to another 
is bad both technically
and from point of view of pissing people off
"anyway, I'm just meant to be doing a mail drop"
TTFN
might find this interesting
http://www.shoplifestyleonline.com/my007.html
"[16:19:37] <telsa> chillywil: it's *supposed* to be portable, I thought that was its entire point for existing."
finally my connection has restabalized
chillywilly: it's good to hear that
especially from somebody like telsa :)
yep :)
it is supposed to work on POSIX systems
bbl (dinner time)
mcb30: wow you eat late
(sigh) bedtime for me
hey mcb30
zero code day today :(((
I have seen your posts on the lists haven't I?
night all
night
blah blah blah
blah blah?
blah
blah blah?
blah blah blah
guess I'm gonna try cheetah with webware
unless someone has a beta version of a ported post/php-nuker ;-)
hehe
ported?
hmm.. nah gonna put that off I think
I thought PHP was portable
no I want webware tools ;-)
a GNUe/webware/webforms CMS would be cool
guess I better get to work.. ;-) but I would be if I had madlocks code
yeah.. I just have to wait uggh
I've got to make a minor change tho..
uggh lag
I minor change on about oh... 30 some pages or more
would you like some cheese whine?
:P
hehe
I'm not good doing the tedious
back
sigh
hey
yello
green
*thwap*
jcater
"no, it doesn't look like much of a bitch & moan to me"
huh?
irc logs shows otherwise
editing lyx files with a text editor is not acceptable
it's no different
than editing docbook
with a text editor
docbook is a standard format
lyx uses its own markup
no
which is not documented anywhere
lyx is LaTeX
no!
have you looked at a LyX file??????
irtfm
um
of course
I did too :)
it is not 100% LaTeX
it is psuedo lyx tags
"oh, you're right"
the first line is
\lyxformat 218
damn
that made it hard to understand
the rest of the latex
sigh
well I haven't read my mail yet
I still think it is bullshit
if you want LaTeX then why not texinfo?
drop it man
"dude, if someone wants to go with the standard packages distro stuff and be able to modify the docs easily then the must use non-free libxforms to get lyx working"
temporarily?
"I realize thats a problem, but the plan is that its temporary... AFAIK"
can we agree on atleast that chilly?
"I think everyone is on your side, its just a matter of timing as a result of relying on other Free Software"
can I view the current forms tech refernce?
is it on the web?
can we not provide translated documents?
ie. one method for author (which is temporary) but translated to a more universal method of reading?
s/author/authoring/
this is what is mist pissiing me off....and that crack about RMS was really shitty jcater as all I said was that I like to not run non-free software and I use vrms to make sure I am not using it
last time I had to install lyx to even read the current forms tech ref
that was not cool
so what will it take to make it translated?
"Mr_You: that's what we do... we don't actually distribute the Lyx... we convert to text, ps, pdf, and html for the distros"
"so chilly, just create your docs how ever you want, if thats what you want to do"
guess I should just downgrade myself to a user?
Mr_You: that would require installing non-free software to do that easily
that's the whole point
I don;t see you guys committing any formats that would be useful for those of us wishing to keeo our system free of non-free software
uggghh
lag
I know that you don't distribute it as lyx
duh
"chilly, I think you're making this too big a deal, AT THIS TIME... "
you haven't been able to convince anyone that another software package is as useful AT THIS TIME
well because I wanted to look at  the forms form a higher level without diggin into code and this wa s abarrier
even I had problems with exporting the docbook
"as time goes on, we can move to another solution"
why is that such a problem?
I realize it goes against your philosophy.. but philosophy shouldn't get in the way of progress if it is a temporary issue
its just a minor temporary issue in the huge scheme of things
I don't think it threatens our integrity
why not just do it in text and then mark it up later then everyone csn read development docs without the B.S.
go for it chilly.. you have your valid reasons 
Mr_You: the easy way to do that would be to run lys and copy and paste I will not install it again until I can run it easily with a Free GUI
"you just haven't been successfull in convincing others at this time, I have no doubt you may be able to in the future, as everyone agrees with you ideally but technically its a minor issue"
it is not *minor*...it makes us look bad
chillywilly: emails like what you sent make us look bad
"chillywilly: like I said, don't let your own philosophy stop progress.. work around it quickly and overcome it eventually"
NO documentation makes us look bad
constant bickering makes us look bad
chillywilly: so don't make us "look bad" by doing it your own way
"jcater: you're not willing to compromise and stick to principles....dude, it is a huge barrier for developers that do not want to install non-free software"
chillywilly: it is no barrier unless you make it one
chilly: this is temporary.. and the major developers are the ones coming in here and chatting with us.. if any new major developer has a problem I'm sure we'll hear it and it will give your argument much more weight
chillywilly: compromise doesn't always happen exactly when someone would like it to
"simple fact is that it hindered me from reading the forms tech reference....it was a very frustrating experience and I asked that it please be stopped, but no one gives a crap"
so fuck it
so I would seriously like to request  that you find a work around or other solution to your problem and look forward to a permanent solution in the future
you hinered yourself based on your philosophy
as I understand it
my solution would be to do texinfo...now if someone were to say this is what we will do then fine...but al I got was jamest saying that it was texinfo and ppl didn't like it
chillywilly: it was texinfo and people bitched and moaned about the archaic format
personally
and lyx is less archaic?
I'd prefer everything to be 
"no, I'm saying a solution to *your* problem specificly with not being able to load the docs"
in ASCII format
I'm just requesting that we put this off til another time...
I think it is short sighted to think I am the only one
who will come accross these issues
like I said before..
this is temporary.. and the major developers are the ones coming in
+here and chatting with us.. if any new major developer has a problem I'm sure
+we'll hear it and it will give your argument much more weight
"too much lag, and wasting time discussing this, I've vvoiced my opinion... gonna do some work"
ditto
gonna do cheetah
hey will this work:
Cheetah: 
"generates HTML, SGML, XML, SQL, Postscript, form email, LaTeX, or any other text-based format"
;-)
what is cheetah?
a template system for webware
ah
hehe
GNUe-Reports will do that too
maybe we should just document in a database
:)
j/k
yeah hehe
"ugggh ok, not doing anything other than GNUe+webware+""madlocke code"""
"wonder when this lag will stop tho, can't do much of anything"
ahh actually these changes won't be so bad
sense I seperate most of the site into parts
and concatenate the parts
jcater: I'm childish now?
yes
btw
I said the email was childish
not you
I wrote the email
I am not gonna have this conversation
the day I see a document submission to gnue-clients from you is the day I will take your bitching seriously
"yeah just drop it chilly, everyone has said and done things that might be consider inappropriate by each side"
all you are doing is alienating me and making me want to drop out of this project
is that what you want????
you're alienating yourself too.. which I believe you or someone else already pointed out
its really minor the in the big scheme of things
and temporary.. 
I think we should leave it at that
those who oppose can join you in your argument and quest for change
don't expect that to happen right away
"jcater: I don't want you to drop out, but you know how you fee right now that is how I feel when having to install a non-free hindered software and when I couldn't really read the forms technical refernce it realy sucked and when I asked jamest about not using LyX he basically bit my head off....but anyway I am dropping it now..."
sorry
Freedom will come after everyone finishes their beer.. ;-)
"chillywilly: for the record, I've always understood your point... and like Mr_You said, this isn't permanent"
hehe
or pepsi
relating to another quote
Mr_You: i know
Mr_You: about phpgw moving off SF?
"yeah, atleast the article about SF in general"
signing over copyrights..
SF is in a sad state
seeing the demise of greatbridge.org and SF... I wonder the idea of setting up a public developer site like these
I hope that GNUe can give Free Software a light unto a good business model
what is their business model?
whose?
SF?
selling proprieyary add-ons
blech
heathens!  ;)
no FSF
they're non-profit
:P
come on now.. non-profit isn't a business model :-P hehe
they take donations and sell CDs and t-shirts
ahh
oh
mand manuals
and
software manuals
I tell you about my future music project which will be a non-profit?
sorta
tell me again
sonicalchemy.org (nothing there yet)
basicly the idea is sonicalchemy.org will be my music or collaborations with other unfamliar but really good musicians..
"or it will be a label.. or will still have a band, but I might not play in it."
"I was looking for a guitar pick earlier, but I could not find one"
its purpose will be to put more visibility to artist on the CDs or in the group for future work of these people outside of sonicalchemy.org
then I gravitated toward my computer
and forgot about jamming
"another member in the band will be donations to orgs like amnesty, greenpeace, etc.."
maybe FSF heh
it will have a philosophy describing its purpose
maybe that's why I ma just being a mean ol' bastard...I didn't rock out and unwind
so what you think?
cool
"it will take me a good while to get started, like most things I do hehe"
good things come in due time tho
damn this is fucking frsutrating
its a way for individual musicians to become more visible and in turn also contribute to a non-profit org
I was inspired by a christian group called echonet.org (I think) that donates/sales CDs to countries that need imported seeds to have a sustainable crop.. and they teach these farmers of arid areas how to maximize their irigation systems
yeah thats the domain
I said CDs?!?
s/CDs//
seeds?
heh
yeah.. one to 10 seeds have been know to reproduce thousands (in some cases hundreds of thousands) of sustainable and growing crops around the world
because they choose plants that are best suited for that area..
they also go to the local markets to see where and what is being sold
as that is also important

"not to fan the flames, but isn't lyx GPL ? do you HAVE to install non GPL stuff to use lyx?"
i thought that was only if you compiled your own?
yes
np
no
"oh, what do you HAVE to install?"
links to libxforms
xforms lib
evil free beer
:P
LyX rocks!
agreed
pity it uses a closed library
"as soon as it goes QT or GTK, I'll get rid of xforms"
xforms sux completely
it's actually a shitty toolkit anyways
very
mdean: you shouldn't use it anyway
heretic
you will be burned at the stake
bah!  it does a great job at *document* processing
no one expects the GNU inquisition
mdean: i've been peeking at webkit
Maniac: finding good stuffs?
there don't seem to be any reference implementations
i.e. who actually has built somethin with it?
mdean: so your freedom can be taked away if I write some software that rocks?
taken
*sigh*
chillywilly: eh?
LyX saves a very significant amount of time assembling docs
at the cost of making you use non-free software for all thr features
and I know I'd rather be coding than documenting
i'd rather be sipping whiskey but that's besides the point :)
that's a price I will not pay
free beer is better than paying an arm and a leg for a commericial toolkit
someone needs to write phpgroupware ala webware
free beer is no better than proprietary....it is the same damn thing
the lyx code itself is free.  the lyx team are making efforts to enable lyx to run with properly free toolkits.
lyx is GPL
says so on the website
"yes they are, but I am not going to us eit until then"
mcb: yeah - the Qt port is nearly complete it seems
http://www.devel.lyx.org/guii.php3
I found bugs in LyX
looks liek their getting close
mdean: chilly doesn't like QT tho ;-)
which I think lies in xforms
Isomer_: just incomplete features
but anyway damnit I don't wanna talk about this shit anymore...I hate QT it is dman ugly
Mr_You: that's ok - everyone has their quirks
"Maniac: try starting it missing one of it's fonts, and it cores on startup"
mdean: yeah.. 
Isomer_: which ver?
Maniac: no indication in anything (inc the backtrace) as to why
dunno
why should I use a KDE desktop when I got a GNU desktop?
Isomer_: in M$ you would need to re-install windows in order to fix that
Maniac: true
but when I've got a document due tomorrow
chillywilly: you have a choice - which is what is *really* important
it doesn't help me if I can't look at the code to figure out why and to fix it
mdean: I choose GNU whenever I can
that is *my* choice
sorry your choice is a frustrating one
"bah, I need a break from this shit...time for some GNUe hacking....muuwahahahaaha"
Mr_You: eh?
:)
Mr_You: that is totally your opinion
chillywilly: was sympathizing with you
uh?
empathizing?
oh duh
your choice appears to have created frustration
whatever man I am burnt to a crisp
me? them? who?
stop conduzzzilating me :P
for you mainly
"well, I for one am happy that I can run KDE or GNOME or Windowmaker or whatever - same for any productivity software"
it is all excellent software IMO
yeah I choose to install all of those
ja
"but I'll tell yah, its annoying when I run a GTK app and the GNOME tool bar comes up.. guess I can disable that somehow"
GNOME is pretty configurable
Gnome is a real hackers desktop
for that very reason
:P
"IMO, it shouldnt' do that by default"
maybe its fixed or will be
hmm wonder what a fiberoptic christmas tree looks like.. just heard it mention in a mercial

dude it is those tree with the fibers sticking out
they change colors and shit
ah
woohoo!  I got python and glibmodule methods compiled into geas simultaneously!
we need a language plugin system
first things first ;-)
and the methods are loaded on the fly too....I thought we could use a cache-like system
and methods needs some sorta protection so a bad method will not bring the wole server down
mcb: you up to that task ;)
gimme a break - today is the first time I've programmed anything serious in C!
heheh
justs staing what needs to be done
stop whining and start coding! ;-)
dynamic loading looks as though it would be feasible
"chillywilly: yes, you take that advice, get to it before i set a trout on you!"
"and it's something I'd liek to have, because it would make it much easier to prototype business objects"
ajmitch: no comments form the peanut gallery
plz
;P
has anyone else tried the site navigation bar in Mozilla?  it kicks arse!
"but no more coding for me until I can commit what I've got to CVS, which means waiting for the FSF forms"
mdean: no way I use galeon
:P
may as well be using Mozilla ;-)
mozilla doesn't do tabs
the site nav bar puts links for site navigation
does to
and save sessions
it's had tabs for a month or two
and Galeon doesn't have the site nav bar
wtf is that?
makes reading GNUe docs easier
ack!
who would do such a thing ;)
"I have a bar with links for Top, Up, Previous, and Next"
some others are greyed out
guess it recognizes docbook pages and can display the navbar for them
but does it do LyX?
"oh, it can do it all! ;-)"
hmmm

did that work for you andrew?
uhm
"webware has been working for awhile, didn't get UIwebware to go yet"
only tried that for 5 min
but you could connect to webware with your browser?
yes
http://ajmitch.dhis.org/WK/
"no, I mean connect to the port of the webware/webkit appserver"
with your web-browser (like it says in the docs)
uhm
waht was port again?
ie. http://ajmitch.dhis.org:8086
"it sits, it waits..."
"ok, I think yours is doing the same as mine then"
if you stop/start webware you will see the output in your terminal
"hmm, k"
gotta setup apache
don't need to restart it
webkit works fine even with this problem tho
cool
no I was just saying you would see the resulting error in your terminal if you restart it
the error when trying to connect with your browser
ah
you don't connect to the app server
cd (path/to/WebWare/WebKit)
python Launch.py AsyncThreadedHTTPServer
the test was connecting to a built-in webserver & appserver
which is why it now fails :)
it says you can in the docs tho heh

"reinhard_: yes, I saw it"
reinhard__: what is the status of gnuef geas dbdriver?
i think it is not working yet
jamest started it
but has been mad goat raped in the middle of the development process
mad goat == RealLife(tm) work
heh
Was it working at some time in past?
Or it never working before? ra3vat said thet it has working...
sevik: well parts of it worked in the past
and i think they still work
which means gnuef can get data from geas
and write data back to geas
but you cannot yet use the methods and some other things
you can use geas just like a normal relational db
and you loose all the advantages of objects
it does not works now
even retrieving of data from geas
i have not looked at it for 2 months now i think :(
ok
actually it would be my job to do it
as i "maintain" geas
but i have some overload at my work job currently

hi all
hi
hello neilt
neilt: you have a minute for me?
psu: if you are really serious about creating irc digests you are the hero of the year
mini-hero. My first trial one only took a couple of hours
probably less now I've got the hang of it.
Also Kernel Cousin stuff should really only be about development
sounds like a not-so-fun job :)
At least I still get to read about all the fish-slapping
even if I can't really justify including it in the summaries.
haha
be glad that they don't talk about mad goats much anymore
"At the moment, the volumes are such that it's a bit of a non-job"
but hopefully that will change over time
goats and all
:)
gotta go now
"such a pity treshna isn't part of development, they made irc interesting ;)"
just dropped in whilst collecting e-mails (dial-up)
ok
l8r psu
bye
but remember - you can pretty much count on me reading the back log ;-)
:)
back
"reinhard: i do now, whats up"
neilt: thanks
first question
are you ok with my answer re: changing from hash table to list?
"yes, I think so, I have not looked at it directly"
i don't think it has major performance impact
ok
next
i don't think I value the ordered list as much as you do
maybe
i think about designer and such stuff
"thats why i trust your judgement, I have not thought about that stuff"
ok :)
iirc we have no real use for public and private for now
"yes, i seem to remember that"
i propose to take it out until we find a really useful thing to do with that
or we will end up with a lot of non-implemented keywords just like before
you agree?
"ok I agree to taking everything out that is not fully implemented, unless it will be implemented in the next few tasks we are working on"
ok
i hate partial stuff
"would this be the case for READONLY, too?"
i dont know the status of READONLY
what works and what does not work
ok i will investigate what READONLY does now
next
does inheritance make sense for types?
no
ok
(good discussion you agree with everything :) )
;)
cool
:)
the current syntax for explicit reference is
REFERENCE (otherclass)otherfield = thisfield;
current = old classdef or = your new classdef?
we have no single use of this syntax in current gcd's except the testing
both
i kept it compatible
at least that's what i wanted
"i think we need explicit reference, i also hate the syntax"
same goes for m
me
i think a syntax could be better like this:
I would rather see something more verbose
REFERENCE thisfield = otherclass.otherfield;
example
  char country <2>;
  reference the_country: country = country_table.country_code;
fscking bad example
i hope you get it
GET REFERENCE WHERE thisfield [=<>!] otherclass.otherfield
the reference has a name
"my bad, not well thought out example"
REFERENCE refname WHERE thisfield [=<>!] otherclass.otherfield
sounds good
for psu:
***************************
proposal for changed REFERENCE syntax in gcd:
REFERENCE refname WHERE thisfield [=<>!] otherclass.otherfield;
***************************
:)
neilt: what do you mean with [=<>!]?
for references only = should make sense
"equal to, less than, greater than, not equal"
as a reference would only return a single record by definition
"ok, then what I said applies for list"
otherwise it would be a list
yes what you said :)
you agree that implementation of <>! is not soooo urgent?
"why do we need reference, why not just list"
and a reference is just a list with one entry
a reference is for aggregate objects?
neilt: actually you are right
i think
or is it because references are static and lists are dynamic
no
actually both could be combined by a sorta
RELATION
keyword
which is n : n
n : m
where n and m can be 1 or more than 1
for implicit we still need both * and []
but for explicit i think we could replace both REFERENCE and LIST with RELATION
or would you know a better word for it?
reinhard: relation sounds good for now
ok
**************** end reference/list discussion ***********
psu: we help where we can :)
hehe
last question
chillywilly: yes they run a school bus company in kansas city
"shall we keep andrewm's profiling code, or shall we remove it?"
rip it out
all that timer stuff
it is fugly
reinhard: do we need it to profile?
the compiler should be able to profile for us
i thought we could profile without all of the that explicit code
i have zero experience in profiling
we should try some profiling before we remove it
ok
or contact andrewm and see why he did that
there must have been a reason
is andrewm still at treshna?
nope
probably he did not know the other possibilities if there exist some
but we have an emerygancy email address
i will try to find out how profiling works
just send email to andrewm@gnue.org
it is forwarded to his personal email
chillywilly: can you give me a pointer where to start the search?
lemme ask some hurd hackers
is that it for a bit
?
yes
thanks neilt
your welcome
bbl
i will investigate about readonly
and profiling
cool
and let you know
[16:10:24] <XiDEX> chillywilly compile the beast with "-pg -a" and run the program
[16:10:31] <XiDEX> chillywilly then run gprof
chillywilly: thanks
"[16:11:01] <XiDEX> chillywilly oh yeah, you should use the program in the normal way you use it too, or if you want to know what part is slow, use that part"
[16:12:02] <XiDEX> chillywilly proggie; gprof proggie > log
[16:12:05] <devvil> gnu.org -> GNU software
"er, you can ignore the last line"
hey jamest
********************************
neil-away:
from the "old" (andrewm) code:
<snip>
  |        READONLY readonly              { $$ = NULL; /* TODO */ }
<snip>
********************************
READONLY is not more than another useless reserved word currently
"[16:16:14] <XiDEX> oh yeah, -a will record how many times a block gets executed..."
"ok, that's wnough on profiling"
enough
yeah
thanks a lot chilly
no problem
reinhard: then drop it
we dont need not stinking READONLY
hehe
that's an idl keyword
iirc
chillywilly: Pssst.. hey buddy.
hi
wassup dude?
chillywilly: gcd structures never go thru CORBA so i dont think it matter that it is a IDL keyword
chillywilly: Geas doesn't seem to compile under windows because of the orbit dependancy.  Do you have a timeframe for fixing that?
"yes, I agree"
"jbailey: uh, no"
"chillywilly: Okay, so I'm officially not worrying about making geas part of the win32 package for now then.  Lemme know."
jbailey: go ahead an fix it :P
we won't object
"chillywilly: nmp, sorry dude. =)"
I'm only packaging the beast.  =)
man
you trying to get orbit to compile on cygwin?
or what?
GEAS only runs on GNU/Linux and *BSD
chillywilly: and mac os X
oh sorry
and OS X
"Well, I was trying to make sure that any auto* environment I set can DTRT for Windows and Linux (assuming everything else will take care of itself somehow *grin*)"
DTRT?
"but GEAS doesn't seem capable of running under windows, and I wanted to check that it's okay to not worry about it."
DoTheRightThing.
oh
doh
porting GEASto windows is not a priority
right now
suits me fine ;)
man gobject and orbit2 are both thread safe now and pretty functional
;)
gobject has rtti stuff and dynamic loading
GTypeModule looks cool
jbailey: fwiw i compiled orbit under windows (using cygwin)
but never run any program
so i don't know if it would work
i _compiled_ geas under windows
"IIRC, It doesn't work."
later all
*******************
message to neilt
imho we can use gprof
as derek would say "gprof kicks butt"
it gives you statistics about time spent in each function
as well as number of calls for each function
sorted by the worst functions first (those eating most time)
and lots of other stuff
plus you can break it down to lines of code instead of functions
the only thing is it only measures cpu time
not the time the process waits for disk access or network traffic
OTOH andrewms profiling code measures the RealWorld(tm) time spent in a function
i.e. how late it was when entering the function and how late it was when leaving
which is a _very_ inaccurate thing in a multi process operating system imho
however i will _not_ remove the profiling stuff until your feedback
end message

'sup??
hey hey mdean
howdy
hi
hi derek
"bah, masta does not get a 'hi' from any slave"
what does he get?
"'i humbly bow before thee, o masta' ?"
a trout slappin' of course
:P
sheesh
when are you gonna learn ajmitch
"no, that's what you get"
heh
some flight got grounded
ouch
why?
you little punk
some letter.. very vague right now
cnn.com
another baking-powder letter?
I dunno
today's flight is brought to you by the letters A N T H R and X
anthrax dude
:P
"uh oh, dtm is here"
:-o
run!
hmmm I installed a kernel image but it didn't boot with it
had a panic on bootup ;)
hmm.. maybe I need to reinstall.. its not in the boot menu
I dunno whether to use the Pentium Classic or 586 image for a P166MMX
I guess pentium classic
hi
sup g?
238kBps is nice
cable is like dual T1s ;-)
probably cached tho heh
at least when downloading :)
uploading is a beotch
not my problem ;-)
lol
sup all?
yo aj
ya'll
thats how we talk
sounds better
my apologies
;-)
yep
I wonder if DVDs are bootable
I had one that got all scratched up
I booted it clear across the room
lol
hehe
uggh
hosed lilo
that bad
i remember one time it stuffed up badly :(
yeah..
install floppies wouldn't fix it either
oh wait
hmm
I might have forgotten somethin
install cd (booted off that and ran rescue image) worked for me  the second time round
"i basically mounted /, and ran chroot /mnt /sbin/lilo"
now i just use grub
yeah its not a huge deal
maybe this is a sign haha
a sign?
"hehe, well I need to look at the new installer anyways ;-)"
"ah, ok ;)"
quiet in here
"err, passes"
rofl
didnt help still quiet in here
jcater: you getting lots done?
well
I just took my Banana Walnut Bread out of the oven
and it tastes good
but I've just been to darn tired to do GNUe tonight
:(
"which is bad, because I had the time tonight :("
whoa
no way
i watched blow tonight
and was wanting to look up some movie trivia
and i stumbled across
the bourne identity (schedule for release in 2002)
dont know if you like robert ludlum books but this is a MAJOR production starring matt damon
cool
"hmm, i'm waiting for the fellowship of the ring to come out "
and julie stiles
http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258463
she rocks
no tolkien fans here then? ;)
ajmitch: tolkien was ok
i never much was a fan
i like my science fiction a little more hard ;)
hehe
whacked
i saw frank herbert's son co-authored a new dune
fun?
"yeah, i haven't done much reading this year"
wtf is that?
"jcater: ie, not reading manuals & programming books"
but
that's fun? right?
or textbooks for exam study ;)
fsck
"rofl, ive convinced my self 'computer language books are fun'"
julia stiles is 4 yrs younger than I
hehe
derek: i got a nice thick 'programming python' book here ;)
"gotta keep myself busy over summer, i got nearly 4 months off ;)"
(once i finish exams in 2 weeks)
rofl
to both of you
jcater what year you born in ?
'77
"ouch, now i feel really old"
i know it will be bad when some one says so and so is good looking and their birthday is past my graduation date
until then there is still hope :)
rofl
I'll worry when the good looking ones are my son's age :)
derek: what has happened to GEAS hacking?
"that didn't quite come out right, but you get the picture :)"
yes i get the picture (pervert)
;)
ajmitch: dont know
"i have a lot to do, but think i need sleep instead"
k
sleep?
fun?
http://forchrist.com/fun.jpg
should provide y'all wit sum entertainment
rofl
"of course, that looks like copyright infringement"
you becoming a terrorist?
crap you're on to me
in the states we have 'hard hats'
the darth vader helmet looks kinda like equiv of 'hard turban'
ajmitch: i advise against it
unless you like undue pain
OR
derek: hehe
"you want to kernel hack, write device drivers or other tedious programming items"
C has little place IMO outside things that used to be done in assembler or things where speed is very very important
"gonna rewrite GEAS in python then, or will you find some poor fools that use C?"
we have poor fools already
but we still are taking applications
hehe
"i already know C, and need to use it next year at uni"
"i can honestly say, im not envying you"
"course, C is great for ""open source"" projects where the author doesn't REALLY want to share the code :)"
but then i recall on monday i get to play test the mainframe interfaces because of the mainframe upgrade and realize that cobol is as fun AND functional as C so I share your enjoyment :)
hehe
i don't mind C too much ;)
C has its uses
but i agree with jasons last comment
the only thing i can think of to make your code 'less' shareable
'write it in perl' ;)
rofl
actually the BEST program
woudl be one written in C
that often breaks out to assembler
but is randomly thrown in a directory structure
perl makes /dev/random seem readable by comparison ;)
and you avhe to run a perl program to build the header files :)
hmm
you been studying gnome again?
rofl
actually i was thinking of gnucash
but gnome is same ;)
hehe

how go things w/ gnuef?
i wouldn't know
i don't think I've touched it in a month

aren't you working on it anymore?
i should be
but i've been way too busy with real life crap
just like now
Now how that goes! ;)
I'm heading out the door for a b-day party for my daughter

seva_: what language is that?
javaguy: russian :))
javaguy: with english letters :))
"Oh, Cool!"
"I haven't the slightest clue what you're saying, but it sure looks neat"
:))
javaguy: it's about my progress with gnue :))
i'll got working geas and gfclient
but gfclient doesnot show records from database
"i checked database with psql, there are records :))"
and country dropbox in form empty
sorry back
seva_: can you make gfclient display the UI using cyrillic <sp?> characters?
i'm dont know :))
"Man, that would be cool if you could"
"Probably not a high priority, but it would still be cool"
javaguy: cirillic works
ra3vat: got any screen shots?
 UnicodeError: UTF-8 decoding error: invalid data
javaguy: i did it not for screenshots sorry :)
we should post screen shots showing gnuef being used to show the same UI
for different locales
seva_: there should be some fixes not in cvs
Cool.  Mandrake has a mirror up on CAC at Penn State
what form will you suggest for screenshoting?
how about person.gfd?
AttributeError: GEAS_RecordSet instance has no attribute '_modifiedFields'
it's when i press commit button
seva_: what form do you test?
person.gfd
from gnue/gnuef/samples/geas
country dropbox empty

"heh, anything that i type goes to form in upper case"
"it's not a python/wxPython issue, wxTextEntryDialog demo from wxPython distribution works ok"
anyone know why I wouldn't be able to run a python script?
I'm trying to build gnue.  typing './setup.py' gets me an error
bash: ./setup.py: No such file or directory
permisions on setup.py are 0755
"well, 'python setup.py' works, so I suppose it's not a big deal..."
javaguy: it's about interpreter in first line of file
shebang line is '#!python'.  I have python in PATH (/usr/bin/python)
<nitpick>
javaguy: kernel does not check path for interpreter
setup script says 'Press Control-D to abort or any other key to continue'
so you must write full path or standart hack of "/usr/bin/env python" 
env does path search
but I have to press Return before the script recognizes the key press
</nitpick>
javaguy: its line discipline issue :))
you must switch terminal to raw mode before doing per char input
Ok.  Changing shebang works
Any reason we are using #!python instead of #!/usr/bin/env python ?
really kernel does limited path search for user.cs_path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:
"so if you are lucky, it works :))"
but python is in /usr/bin
"so #!python should work, right?"
it depends :))
is there a situation where #!/usr/bin/env python wouldn't work?
only in env not in /usr/bin :))
"now that I think about it, gnuef is supposed to be cross-platform"
there would be no /usr/bin/env on windows or mac
really this line must be filled by configure/etc
do other platforms use the shebang line?
"imho, nt nas some processing"
but i'm not sure
really extension have preference on windows
"so, shebang will most likely be used only on UNIX"
yes

Can sed edit files in place?
don'
t think so
ah well.
ed might work for you if it's simple enough
for x in *diff; do   sed -e s/binutils-2.11.92.0.5/binutils-2.11.92.0.10/ $x >$x.new; mv -f $x.new $x; done
It's ugly but it works. ;)
:)
And the binutils package churns away.
"Anyone here running windows, and would you mind testing an executable for me?"
i dont have a 'monitor'
and windows is a monitor mandatory os unfortunately :(
"oh well. =)  I found a debian package that uses the mingw32 libraries instead of the cygwin stuff.  If it works for a simple binary, I'll try compiling the gnue code with it."
"but I need to test a hello world app, first."
"what i find odd, funny etc"
is people say linux is worthless
yet 0 out of 8 people here have windows box to readily test a hellow world app
hwen i say people say its worthless substitute people w/ press
I've been running nothing but GNU/Linux on my computer for 6 years or so..
"well, as my primary OS.  Angie likes her video games. ;)"
:)
windows is nothing more than child game station and quicken to me
and development platform occassionally for porting folks OFF of windows
"as soon as non-development tools mature on linux, hopefully I can switch at work"
derek: Have you looked at gnucash lately?  It does a very nice job.
jcater: Which tools specifically?
"as soon as I can get QuarkXPress for Linux, my whole office will convert :)"
but I'm optimistic
as Quark is primarily a Mac app
and they will HAVE to port to Mac OS X
Quarks' a tough one because it's so specialized.
yip
"Most geeks don't want to do publishing, so it's less likely to get coded.,"
"jbaily: Gnucash is nice, but no on-line bill paying"
"ToyMan: Ah.  Quicken's stuff doesn't work in Canada (last time I checked), so that wasn't a show stopped for me."
is Quark working on a 'nix version???
ToyMan: not currently
only Win and Mac
"It's ugly enough, and clunky enough, it'd fit right in."
"'course, framemaker is available for unix"
but it's slightly different
I'm talking about thier "we'll write the checks for you" thing..what is it called?  I forget
my wife uses it A LOT.  
gnucash is nice if you are running the latest and greatest
otherwise forget it
and I could never get her to switch until that hole is plugged
1.4.x works but try 1.6 on redhat 6.2
derek: Almost all Free Software sucks unless you use the latest version. =)
honestly i think gnucash development is a cluster job (sorry)
"even though from a financial control viewpoint, Quicken is a conceptual mess"
jbailey: they have like 600 dependencies
that arent even common
its REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD
join their mail list
they get hundreds of rpms dont work for me
etc
quicken clone should install EASILY
it seems backwards for a *nix program to require you to completely upgrade your OS to use it
as its the first thing a non techie trying windows is likely to attempt
er trying linux from windows
anyhow i wont publicly discuss anymore :)
gnucash is a good project doing good things
bsd ports has 1.6.2_1 is that the most current?
nope but close enough
i think 1.6.4 might be newest
hmmm.  I think I'll wait.  /me is using his fileserver for a 'nix workstation at the moment
wich is a BAD thing...;)
um better than using a windows workstation :)
and i think I won't push my luck with apps I don't really need at the moment
you wont need gnucash :)
not at work anyhow
"uh, I tried that with my NT4 fs...unbelievably slow...and flakey"
well i hope not!
"derek: Nope, you'll need the accounting module in GNUe. =)"
you mean you guys aren't working on a gnucash plugin???
jbailey: i was thinking all funds just went to gnue bank account
ToyMan: i tried
"heh, i was kidding..."
thats why i said i wont speak publicly anymore
there is a LARGE history behind the two projects
I've never considered quicken or gnucash for anything other than home.  It's not built for it.
"Mind you, I use to love Accpac, so that might show where I'm coming from."
nothing like a double-entry ledger for my paltry bank account :)
and I'm sure wife can justiify a complete "payables" system
although "receivables" might not need to be installed
IC?
or it might be better not knowing... =)
lol
"heh, outlook 6 couln't import my wife's outlook5 mail, but Kmail could..."
shitheads
Don't say that.  I've got a paying job to stuff an outlook5 mailbox into outlook 6.. 
make sure you EXPORT from outlook5
it doesn't work to just copy the .dbx files over anymore
and for some reason outlook 5 isn't included in the import list for outlook6
that's just brilliant...
"The outlook 5 is corrupted and crashes, so I'm going to try installing outlook 5 on my machine (if I can find it) and load it in there so I can export it properly."
but with .NET all this will be solved... upgrades will happen without you knowing :)
make sure you virus scan the old mailbox
"That's not true, they show up on your credit card statement!"
jcater: only your credit card will know...
"about the virus scan, if you've got infected messages and are running some some scanning software on the new box"
the transfer will likely choke and die if it finds a bad one..
at least it did for me :(
i cant handle the privacy issues windows has anylonger
its just wrong evil and soon to be legal
privacy?
I thought the PATRIOT act did away w/that already?
yes it did
its really a sad state
"everyone predicted a hole in the GPL would happen and free software would be doomed, but quite realistically the demise of free software will come in form of legislation"
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-anygui/ ibm is developing a generic gui wrapper for python..
They can't stuff us all in jail. =)
ToyMan: I've looked at that... it will be cool once there's actually filling there :)
"ibm has been coming thru with some nice stuff, this one might make it with them behind it"
:)
yes it looks promising
i might try to use my ibm contacts to see if maybe ibm would take interest in gnue
using htis
this
as it makes gnue even more attractive and thier product more attractive yet maybe we wouldnt have to do any of the work of supporting it :)
good thinking...
could you link to DB2 on the back end?
that would REALLY get their attention!
ToyMan: a guy at IBM wrote out DB2 backend for us :)
out=our
"I don't think it was ""official"" ibm stuff, but none-the-less, it was an IBM dude"
"such a paltry little DB, dunno if it could handle the MASSIVE data flow from a mega-corp such as mine ;)"
"yip, db2 was contributed by a foreign ibmer"
have we released since we've had db2 support?
btw: i think i can now 'test' db2 support at work
just need to install the db2 client libs
cool
"I have db2 here, but haven't had time to test"
I have a plethora of DB's here at home (installed)
just no time to test :(
hmm got my osdl account today
Hrmmm..  Is geas supposed to be able to cross compile to windows?  It uses orbit...
jcater can we release some time soon
jbailey: no
well kind of
"last i heard, geas was windows ready"
BUT it depended on orbit which well didnt do windows well :)
I PERSONALLY am on a kick to lobby that we move to omniORB
which runs on windows just fine
and is much more stable and well built
for business applications is licensed under gpl and rock solid python bindings
the big issue is it has no C bindings :)
BUT
jcater is feverishly working on gcomm an rpc abstraction mechanism that would give lots of flexibility
at minimum omniORB could be used on windows for forms clients
at a maximum geas will use GCOMM and it too can use omniorb :)
derek: Does that mean I can ignore trying to make sure that geas is packagable under windows?
hehe
feverishly?
"actually, that is my current focus"
as I need that abstraction for my reports server
"I basically have the reporting engine done, but no way to ""Serve it up"" :)"
jbailey: yes for now
derek: Excellent!
morning all :)
ajmitch: morning
anyone here competent with postgres
if i have a table with
"myfoo, yourfoo, ourfoo, somefoo, thefoo, toughfoo"
is there a way for me export that data easily
"but only export myfoo, yourfoo, ourfoo"
i know i can do a pgdump to dump the whole table 
"i can write something to do this, but hoping maybe pg has some builtin functionality for this"
i thought select into might work
anyone know anything about this?
"nope, i would guess using sql is best way"
but i have hardly ever used postgres
you can use pg_dump --table="tablename"
jcater but that dumps entire table
suppose that is what i will do
I know that does one at a timeoh
oh
those are columns
hehe... it'd help if I read what you wrote :)
working with postgres remotely is ok for SOME things
but for heavy duty work it just sucks
as its too hard to use programs / tools against it
"at a minimum, you can set up a ssh tunnel w/ssh -L"
yes thats what i need to do
the 'setup' part is too difficult for me :)
derek: you can build postgres with ssl
and use psql -h host database
yes i know
configure --enable-ssl
generate ssl keys put it into data/server.key data/server.csr
yes thas the plan
but i dont have root on that server :)
so it happening today :)
:))
and you can setup sshtunnel ass suggested early too :))
You guys need someone to do a 'kernel cousin GNUe'
jbailey: you wanna volunteer? ;)
If I had time I would.
hi all
psu: Do you have time? =)
"i have time, just dunno what i'm doing"
"(not just re. GNUe, life in general ;-)"
"psu: Well, the kernel cousins are pretty easy, it's a weekly summary of what's happened (IRC, and email lists.  Sometimes ChangeLog's too).  You just need to read them and quickly throw it together.  Typically they're about a page."
hi anybody
i still cant get working geas+gfclient combo 
"IANAP (I am not a programmer), so if I'm going to help with anything, gotta be docs."
See?  This is perfect!
hehe
Have you read the kernel cousins before?  They're at http://kt.zork.net/
yep
nope. off to have a look
"when i start gfclient ..../person.gdf from gnuef/samples/geas/person.gfd i can login, but countriy dropbox is empty"
debug output from geas show query to database for addressbook__country
the same query in psql give results
i can see caountries and persons in geas python sample
"hey, anybody home ? :))"
"I'm here, and I'm recruiting people documentation type tasks.  gnue, hurd, your choice. ;)"
doesn't look too intimidating...
"of course, gnue is almost entirely irc-based rather than mail"
"No, and you can see that they release on their own schedule (although they try for once a week)"
(except for the occasional spam)
"True, but the irc conversations are logged.  No reason you couldn't work from that."
Probably actually be easier than following a long thread over a couple of weeks.
obviously better if I'm around online
"but at a minimum, I could just review the irc logs once a week "
& do a quick summary
presumably both submit it to KC
& post it to the new gnue portal front page
"Yeah.  That way there's regular news up there about summaries, etc."
"yeah, gnue mailing lists that i'm on seem *really* quiet"
"  File ""/home/seva/src/gnue/.cvsdeveldir/gnue/common/dbdrivers/geas/DBdriver.py"", line 58, in _postChanges"

"Well, this will likely draw attention, and hopefully more hackers and other good folks."
"psu: I've spoken to Zack a couple of times, he's really nice.  mailto:zbrown@tumblerings.org"
"to be fair, mailing lists can go to the other extreme"
psu: i know ;)
sevik: what is your geas database name?
"joined one the other day, left after 1/2 a day"
50+ emails.
ra3vat: gnue
Not fun for us poor dial-up users
psu: only 50? i get lots more than that from some lists ;)
i'm subscribed to many lists (and i use a modem too)
I must start doing some serious bullying of my cable operator
about cable modem
it's been "Real Soon Now" since we were "hooked & booked"
sevik:  <database name="gnue" provider="geas" dbname="test" host="localhost"/>
sevik: check what dbname in your person .gfd
may be it should refer to one entry in connections.conf. Am I right/
set it this way - the same
<database name="gnue" provider="geas" dbname="gnue" host="gnue"/>
<database name="gnue" provider="geas" dbname="gnue" host="localhost"/>
"SQL query: 'SELECT addressbook__country.id,addressbook__country.inhabitants,addressbook__country.name,addressbook__country.sys_cre_time,addressbook__country.sys_cre_user,addressbook__country.sys_id,addressbook__country.sys_mod_time,addressbook__country.sys_mod_user,addressbook__country.year_budget FROM addressbook__country ORDER BY addressbook__country.name DESC'"
there are query to db
"hmm, they have some useful tools there for making KC summaries"
sevik: got any success?
no
queries go to postgres and postgres accpts and executes them
ajmitch: I'm sure psu wouldn't say no to help ;

No python2.

yes
installing...

Noone's tried.  They haven't accepted the patches I sent almost a year ago for python1 yet. =(
oh
"I'm sure the autobuilder will try it soon, though."
yeah
i thought the mail list I was on (gnue.gnu.org) was all there was.

"Well, I'm using a P2/233 with 128 megs of ram."
"jbailey: hmm, i've got a K6/233, i might take 128MB from this computer"
thanks ajmitch.
might as well use my computers for something useful ;)
ra3vat: it works
sevik: cool
sevik: what did you do?
ajmitch: I don't need help churning through packages yet - I more need help get bug fixes done.
but need some patching for table name addressbook__person and bday->birthday
"jbailey: ah, k"
jbailey - I will have a go at doing a summary of the irc logs & mail lists for the past week
"it works in 2tier mode, not with geas"
" ajmitch: If you have any time to spare on that, it would be appreciated."
& email it to you for "constructive criticism" 
jbailey: i'll see ;)
"too detailed, too summarised, etc"
psu: Excellent.  jbailey@nisa.net - remind me at the time why you're sending it to me.  I get *way* too much email.
I will also contact Zack about formal Kernal Cousins status
but even if we can't do that 
"new record gives error, but I think it's normal"
ConnectionError: error 'ERROR:  ExecAppend: Fail to add null value in not null attribute sys_id
"' in 'INSERT INTO addressbook__person (addr1,countrycode,name,addr2) VALUES ('23','qw','BUBU','123')'"
at least it can go onto Gnue
sevik: why is it using  _dbsig/DBdriver.py instead of postgresql/DBdriver.py
psu: ;)
sevik: for two tier mode use any other db not those generated for geas
"ok, but I need geas mode :))"
sevik: i see ;)
ra3vat: about _dbsig - possible it's inherited method
in other cases it reports postgresql/DBdriver.py
how I can debug geas mode?
what are status of geas provider for gf ? 
psu: I don't see why he wouldn't give you formal kernel cousin status.  GNUe will be a huge project and need several people to write the summaries as soon as a few more modules are written.

"ok, I'll away for 30-40 minutes"
btw: i plan on doing a weekly summary for gnue VERY soon
just gnue has been 'quiet' lately so didnt want to burst on the scene with a whimper
sounds fun
so psu might be out of a job then? ;)
brb
derek: darn.. I guess I better stop stating my socio-political views in IRC then :)
oh was he volunteering?
"if so tis all his, i only read about 1/3 of my back log"
jcBusy: nah dont do that
how's those diamondbacks doin?
we kicked arse
I'll take that to mean that the Arizona Diamondbacks won?
hey derek
yip 9 to 1
Cool.  I never really could get into competitive sports
so how are things looking for the next release?
CORBA is one confusing mother
(...that was on my fortune cookie :)
hi all :)
anybody alive?...
anybody use gnuenterprise in real projects?
alive?
yes
alive
and in real projects
can u tell me more about your project and using this? :)
I'm interesting is that (gnuenterprise) working?
well currently
i have written a contact manager to do assignments for gnue
jcater has a fully functional 40 node call center using gnue
we also have a customer that uses for insurance claims
have also started bolting on frontends to DCL (double choco latte)
currently gnue forms (in 2 tier mode) is pretty equivalent in functionality and features as oracle's sql*forms product
"dneighbo: Call centre, like using Bayoonne, or forms? (or both?)"
not using bayonne
though they would like to
there are some pbx issues etc they are looking into
jcater : would be the one to ask specifics
we are working on writing up a case study on it
as its really rather a nice setup
all 40 nodes are diskless workstations
so its GNUe on LTSP
with oracle backend
Nice!
"My potential employer is looking at acquiring another Nortel Option 11, and it would be nice to cost compare for using Bayonne for the load balancing."
what is LTSP?
Linux Terminal Server Project
ksuha : also the govt i work for uses gnue in limited capacity to manage a few postgres tables for data interfaces and such
and the university jamest works at uses gnue for several things
i would say if you need database application gnue is about best i have seen for 
RAPID development of cross platform applications that is licensed under the GPL
do u use release or cvs version?
both
in my production environments im using the last release
every where else im using cvs
i need to pester jcater some and i think we will release another version here VERY soon
what about activity of gnue project and quantity of bugs and how fast they are patching?
bugs are generally patched same day
if you can find the developer that maintains that part of code 
most of the developers are in this channel 10 hours a day or more
activity wise we have about 5 active developers
and about 10 more that have contributed code regularly but are not doing so heavily at this time
we have about 30 people with assignments
and several hundred on the main mail list (though most of our process is done in irc not in mail list)
as to quantity of bugs its ahrd to say
as the primary installations of gnue are in use by the core developers
so bugs are patched as soon as they are encountered :)
cool :)
how soon accounting package could be released? :)
"dneighbo: I've started thumping on the cross-compiler environment for you, BTW.  Do you want the result in a tarball or .deb?"
ksuha : accounting is a difficult animal
as beta and accounting dont go hand in foot :)
we have accounting classes (gcd) in cvs now :)
we are starting to do some 'basic' accounting stuff for clients now
a fully functional accounting system i cant put a date on
but paying clients or users willing to use in production ALWAYS help speed along features :)
jbailey both :)
dneighbo: 'k =)
hi all :))
ksuha is away now :))
I'm going to try gnue :))
one more question: does geas use database triggers or does triggers/etc  himself? 
um
good question
it could really do either
i.e. if you wanted to write stored procs in your database you could (i recommend against it as it locks you into that db vendor) Though for something things you can get a large performance boost
geas is designed to have two types of methods
do it use transactions ? for accounting for example and other atomic transfers/etc?
external methods (biz rules)
and internal methods mroe like geas triggers
currently iirc transaction support native to geas is not working
in two tier it is working if the db supports it (iirc)
we are looking to enhance in these areas of course
as well as offer full loadbalancing
and replication
i.e. if you have a geas server with say millions of 'methods' we would provide a way to propogate those classes/methods to other geas servers
"loadbalancing anfd replication without db support, or based on native replication/loadbalancing?"
the data of course would be replicated by the db not geas
ok :))
load balancing we hope to use a 'neutral' load balancer
we are not finding any good gpl ones (though we havent looked too hard)
we would like to do load balancing in front of geas 
"I'm truing to compile it on freebsd and libuuid not found, where can I get source for it ? "
BUT if a db supports it
you could definitely have db load balancing occuring behind geas
um
As db I prefer PostgreSQL  :)) 
its in one efs2prog i think
seva_ so do we :)
:))
"18 To compile GEAS, you additionally need"
 19 * libuuid 1.05 or newer (look for a package called ext2fs-dev or uuid-dev)
 20 or
 21 ftp://download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/e2fsprogs/e2fsprogs-1.19.tar.gz
thanks
from the INSTALL file in cvs (dont know if ships with release or not)
in geas-0.0.6 only * libuuid 1.05 or newer (look for a package called ext2fs-dev or uuid-dev)
ah :)
we get asked a lot so im sure someone added :)
:))
Receiving e2fsprogs-1.19.tar.gz (957756 bytes): 0%
:)) for 10k lib :))
load balancing with GEAS could be complicated
Mr_You: I think so too :)) Especially with objects with state
persistent connection oriented
seva: that too
you could spread connections across a cluster
And what about db connections pooling?
*shrug*
I have some problems with apache+php+persistent connections :)) (with 20-30 apaches*5-6different databases :))
I guess manual/static db connections spread out.. or leave it to the database to handle load balancing.. 
which I imagine postgresql doesn't do yet
there are sql-relay which does it but I'm not tried it 
dneighbo: /usr/ports/sysutils/e2fsprogs - it's for freebsd ports collection
roommate got a dvd+mp3 player
dneighbo: but it does not installs headers :))
"Mr_You cool, i have one and love it"
seva_ as to persistent connects we have looked at sql relay some
as to load balancing i think it would be tricky but do able
"cant get configure to find uuid/uuid.h in /usr/local/include, grrr"
checking Method system to use... test: ==: unexpected operator
test: ==: unexpected operator
unknown - defaulting to gmodule
it's next :))
im at work so dont have all the source or i owuld be of more help
what is your ./configure parameters look like
better yet what distro are you running?
dneighbo: freebsd-4.4-stable :))
dneighbo: env GLIB_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/glib12-config CPPFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include" ./configure
hmmm jcater you here?  you get geas working on BSD
seva_ i know we have one or more folks with geas on bsd
im not a bsd user per say
dneighbo: bsd test does not accept ==
"changed to =, trying .. :))"
please let us know how it goes
ok :))
as we want to make sure we either fix so its not issue for others
or document so other bsd'ers know what to do :)
what time zone are you in seva?
i dont hink any of the geas team is here right now in irc
eest - GMT+3
reinhard will more than likely be on in the morning (austrian time)
which is probably similar to your time
ok
what time is it there?
"22:40, there is plenty  of time :))"
:)
yeah reinhard normally here about 23:00 my time
which is about another 11 hours away
chillywilly is here normally 
the primary geas folks to date are
chillywilly
reinhard
and
neilt
if you are around when i get home i can look into it also
ok :))
jamest can maybe help too
he runs solaris so may have encountered something similar
i'm away for some 20-30 minutes...
what is a difference beetween = and == operators in linux test ?
checking Method system to use... unknown - defaulting to gmodule
is last message ok ?
whoo hoo dvd is cool heh
hiya all
hi jc
another batch of 1000 renewal notices going out... all courtesy of gnue-reports + mailmerge sample :)
"it's compiled with methods=gmodule, started, but when it creates tables/initializes db on first start I got message about ""cannot insert null in not null column classXXX"""
wooo hooo another use of gnue :)
"(well, with a little prodding of course)"
seva_ ah snap
i recall this issue
cant recall if that is 'warning' or if its been fixed
"with methods=python, it want libpython1.5"
you are not using cvs correct?
"dneighbo: for now - yes, geas-0.0.6"
I can use cvs if it helps :))
"do you have cvsup, or only remote cvs ?"
it might help
I hate remote cvs :))
define remote cvs?
we support pserver and ssh
cvs via rsh/ssh (cvs -d server:/home/cvs)
I have only 33600 link at home :))
can I help you setup cvsup server ? :))
seva_: Doesn't -z9 do the job for you?
not for all cases :))
i like cvs diff -u -r HEAD :))
    * You now have a local copy of the repository.
it's not a truth :))
you have local copy of current sources :))
this is on http://www.gnuenterprise.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=2
wazzup!
you guys may remember me from long ago
nope
i wrote a lot of KrappyKode(tm) for gnuef
i see lots of it is no longer in there though
lets see....I also complained about goats alot
now you remember me?
"umm, yeah, the one who claimed that mad goats ran rampant over his code"
mad like angry?  =)
yeah!
thats me!
:)
so what's been up this last week ?
"jcater have reports,forms, and up a whole new rdbms coded up ?"
jamest kind of
reports forms and gcomm (he decided remote procedure call abstraction was more usefull than a new rdbms)
i think he fell ill thouhg
barely averaging 10 commits a day
heh
l8r dudes
ello
anybody home?
nope
nada
:'(
no one loves me anymore
"sulks, even"
heh
'sup?
waddup 'g'
how's life treating you?
like it always does
:(
I hear ya :(
"tis ok, we're here for you dawg ;)"
it's all about da bidness
that's supposed to make me feel better?
ya hear that the patriot anti-terrorism bill was signed?
hey now
Are the components of gnue intended to have seperate or unified release schedules?
ack!
"(bayonne excepted, of course)"
plz shoot me now
well jbailey they generally do
jbailey: not necessarily unified
we keep them separate to gain more exposure
"So it would be better to build them as seperate packages, then."
yes
'k
but iwe are sepearted ad UI/python stuff v. GEAS
wrt release schedules/happening
but this is just by convenience really....or random occurance
we try to release often...
at least once every season
:)
no thanks to me
bad chillywilly
projects
weee!
but hey at least we have a release in sid
yippeee
hehe
Why isn't anonymous aloud to checkout all of the gnue module?  It gets  alock failure in www.
hmmmm
that shouldn't be
in fact I think jcater and renhard are the only ppl who have commited code recently
reinhard
"Blech, that's not setup well.  'www' is a symlink to your web repository, but *that* has different permissions, and is probably not anonymous friendly."
"no, it is.."
"hmm,"
mdean: wassup?
how do you ppl feel about oracle consultants?
nuttin 
are they just as bad as SAP consultants?
pricey
"never worked with SAP - hardly worked with the Oracle consultants, although I had to do the Solaris config for them"
haha
that sounds funny
2.4.14-pre2 is out now ya know
"GNUe wants python 2, yes?"
yep
"er, the python stuff does anyway"
GEAS does not need no stinkin' python
:P
"well, only if you don't want python methods"
"gah, I need a better connection"
hmm
what should I have for dinner?
"Big, Hot, Sexy li'l me. =)"
err..
"now, now... not in public"
now. NOW!..  
*sigh* and then he tells me not in public...
=)
Hmmm..  pot pie.
And I thought you were anti-narcotics.
not that kinda pot
ya goof
"yeah, it'd just make you hungrier anyway."
hehe
or wait..  maybe bush will make it a terrorist act to smoke pot!
"I can't decide between making General Tso's chicken, beef fried rice, enchiladas, or buying out"
I know... Krispie Kreme !!!
a little pie that has veggies and meat and such in it and you bake it
jcater: rofl
meat? eww. =)
vegans are just big weenies anyway
"look at Arc, he's the weirdest flaked out hippy weenie guy you'll ever meet"
jbailey ROCK ON
im not a vegan cause i hate plants :)
dneighbo: you never tall me to rock on
screw you then
"jbailey: btw, I dun get it"
but I am stupid anyway
I need caffiene
mmm... red beans and rice it is!
ick
beans are plants
jcater: That sounds good.  Hmmm.
I bought cumin yesterday.  They didn't have corriander and turmeric in. =(
fuck it I'll just take a bite right out of the cow 
chillywilly: that'd be hairy
true
...
but I don't care
I keep forgetting that cows have hair.
"Hey, if they stand still enough to tip 'em, I sure they stand still enough to shave 'em."
"I mean, how big a bite can you take?  You don't need to shave that much."
cows are lazy
and stupid
a lot like ppl
:D
I think being lazy is pretty darn smart
haha
I gotta here the rationale for this assertion
programmers are lazy too
yup

::P
mmm
"i.e., how to make kernel debs and such"
Raspberry Margarita + Red Beans 'n Rice.... doesn't get much better than this!
don't get all blasted now
where's you get the margarta from? you got a mix?
"er, margarita"
yeah
Major Peters
went by the local restaurant supply store today
and stocked up on stuff :)
hehe
"when I get my ranch, I'll have a GNUe party there :)"
"err, conference :)"
hehe
ranch?
a house you mean?
land
but we'll put a house on it I'm sure :)
oh
wife isn't into the whole camping thing :)
camping is cool
yip
especially in the winter :)
go buy some networking equipment
Well I am pissed at Caroline she was supposed to call me back
fscking women
that can be fun :)
haha
wonder if my ma is back
the invisible man is on scifi now
hmm
how would you know?
if he's invisible and all?
hmm
trout
that'd be good
maybe tomorrow night
not for me
except  can eat canned tuna for some reason
I can
likely story
"uh, no"
I am not fibbing
my mom's like that w/coconut
you wouldn't believe what all has coconut or coconut oil in it
"Lawry's seasoning, Whipped Cream"
just to name a few common things
lawrys?
now that i would NOT have EVER guessed
whipped cream i can believe
but i love coconut so maybe that explains it :)
time to go home
bye bye
see ya all later
later all
GREETINGS
hi
"dtm: chillywilly was looking for your website, what's the URL? ;)"
http://mmmgood.net
Silly chillywilly!
does anybody have working gnuef+geas setup ?
sevik: maybe jamest?
ra3vat: hi is  offline now seems
sevik: personally i had some problem after reinstalling system at home and not tested it for a while
do you have any progress?
for now: working 2 tier mode for gnuef and working geas+python example
so seems geas gnuef driver problem
i'll be at work in 1-2 hours and wiil look at geas driver :))
it worked for me some days
I'm novice in python :))
nadaelo :))
ja hochu sravnit' geas i postgresql i posmotret' chto tam menjalos' v poslednee vremja
"poskol'ku soobshenija ob oshibkah takie, chto pohoge chto vrehnij uroven' (interfejs) pomenjalsja, a konkretno geas'ovyj drajver pod nego ne pomenjali"
on pro vsjakie missing filelds/etc rasskazyvaet
sootvetstvenno i vopros - rabotaet li eto u kogo nibud' i esli rabotaet to na kakoj versii
ne mogu skazat' nichego poka ne vossanovlu svoi ustanovki
"lana, eto konkretika :)) est' eshe para/trojka global'nyh voprosov :))"
mogut li v geas byt' dolgo givushie businessobjects?
t.e. nechto kotoroe startuet/restartitsja vmeste s geas'om i otvechaet na zaprosy/hranit tek sostojanie ?
i v chem raznica/kakaja funkcional'nost' pythom i gmodule method systems?
"t.e. menja geas interesuet imenno ne kak hodilka na bazu, a kak derzhalka n-nogo kolichestva dolgozhivushih objectov"
"t.e. oni budutperiodicheski sohranjat' svoe sostojanie v base, dlja togo chtoby perepodnimat'sja na restarte no v osnovnom oni dolgny git'"
est' li vozmognost' shedulit' sobytija cherez nekotoroe vremja ?
mogut li businessobjects projavljat' vneshnuju activity ? t.e. puskat' programmuliny/etc
poka dumayu do etich voprosov ne mnogie dobiralis
grrr
reshalas zadacha chtobi eto voobshe rabotalo
s drugoi storoni
"prosto u menja est' xotcl'nyj prototip takoj shtuki, no mne ochen' lenivo ego samomu supportit', sootvetstvenno est' gelanie vzjat' chto-to hotjaby na polovinu gotovoe"
pljus mne nugena budet normal'naja bugalterija
pljus mne nugny rabotajushie formochki i gnuef v 2tier mne vpolne ponravilsja
nu buchgalteriyu dla ua ili ru vrjatli kto budet delaat'
osobenno esli budet win32 klient givoj :))
ra3vat: menja interesuet ne realizacija konkretnoggo zakonodatel'stva :))
t.e.menja interesuet realizacija osnovnyh principov - scheta/provodki/glavnaja kniga
t.e. eto budet ne vneshnjaja bugalterija dlja obshenija s nalogovoj :))
s drugoi storoni methodi of businessobject - programma na pythone i tuda moshno vstatit' lyubuyu funcionalnost'
ra3vat: ona givet v address space geas'a ili otdel'nym processom ?
ili eto i est' raznica megdu gmodule i python ? :))
poskol'ku pri python on pitona vnutr' embeddit
navernoe v address space? nado sprashivat reihard ili neilt
a pod chto ty gnue ispol'zuesh'?
poka ni pod chto ser'ezno. V 2-tier mode you menya est gotovaya baza k kotoroi delayu probnie formi
a kak u pithona voobshe s russkimi bukvami ?
delal primer pod geas no bez form dla zabora kursa dollara s rbc.ru
"o, a cheto tam bylo ?"
"t.e. periodicheskaja hodilka, ili hodilka kogda sprosjat s keshirovaniem?"
no rabochi driver forms-geas poyavilsa ne davno i dolgo ne rabotal vizov methods na python iz geas 
jasna
a pro rbc?
tak chto you vsech poka pervie probi
a naskol'ko davno etot project voobshe givet/
aktivno s vesni proshlogo goda 
"pochti dva goda, namana "
geas'om zanimalas firma s novoi zelandii. odin paren' sidel na zarplate 
no seichas ego net
eto ja chital gdeto

"grrr, geas dbdriver does not like as finished or even working :))"
sevik: when you guys talk in all russian we cant help in the backlogs any
yes the geas driver has 'issues' currently
jamest is working to get it back to usable state
if you grab releases it works
but cvs is broken
derek: we do it in hope that more russians will come :)
"derek: ok, thanks"
derek: about russian - in some cases it's too difficult speak english between two
russianspeaking :))
sevik: not critizing i think its GREAT
it shows that gnue is not just for americans
:))
ok
just saying if you are discussing problems that not seeming to solve
if you drop them in english
"though no one maybe around at the time, we often read the back logs and respond in logs"
almost like a mailing list 
definitely not saying dont speak in russian here :)
there was some questions from me about functionality of geas
1. difference between different method systems - python and gmodule
yes that issue
2. possibility of long living objects in geas (which syncs to db periodically for restartinc/crash recovery)
yes geas needs more discussing :)
hi stu
running out door
bbl
heeeeeellllloooooooooooooooooooooooo
Mr_You: hi :))
"whats up, where are you? (ua)"
ua - ukraine :))
ahh
"chernobyl, tu-154 :))"
you worked with GNUe much?
not much :)) from yesterday :))
ahh.. well welcome ;-)
j/k ;-)
:))
you a coder or no?
but seems that i'm going into emergency zone - geas+gnuef :))
coder too :))
"heh, emergency zone?"
seems there are some issues with geasand it's interaction with forms :))
"yeah its currently in the alpha stage, hang out here and help us out and we'll help you out ;-)"
:))
"I looked at code of geas dbdriver, there are some prints :))"
its coming along..
not sure what you mean
in methods like next_record/etc there are print 'something' instead of actual code
"oh, well get to work ;-)"
I code very little.. 
i'm novice in python too :))
i look at it from yesterday :)) same as gnue :))
heh
I'm mostly using tcl 
well gotta go get some stamps.. I'll be sure to watch out for any white powdery substances.. ;-)  bbl
hey chilly
hi
"saw Iron Monkey, best kung-fu movie I've ever seen ;-)"
do you guys think homosexuality is a political cause worth defending?
what rights have been violated?
right to marriage?
I dunno just sounded retarded the way they said it
anyone seen madlocke?
nope
did he ever give up the code for this web forms stuff?
or it still a mystical imaginary animal
:P
hey Mr_You I was jamming the guitar during church service today ;)
sweet
still mystical to me :-(((
and I want to work on it
anyone here smoke?
cigarettes?
not those ;-)
"er, well I juts asked cause I saw someone set an away message about going out for a smoke"
*shrug*
[22:47:21] * dixie is gone. smoke
heh
different channel ;-)
yes
#hurd
"er, channels even"
does anyone know of any Free OLAP servers?
l6r
"er, l8r even"
morning
hello captain
please beam me up
there's no intelligent life down here
:)
:)
"Thanks for beaming me up.  Oh no, there is no intelligent life here either, now what do we do?"
lol
anything exciting happening arround here lately?
not really
a lot of people asked for the geas forms driver lately
:)
are some of you looking at the any-gui initiative ? and the interest there might be for gnue ?
roby: can you give us an url?
"sure, http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-anygui/ for an intro"
reinhard: i hope to fine GNUe time starting this weekend
jamest: cool
lol
" A popular joke about Java is that it is ""write once, debug  everywhere."""
"ANSI C - The *true* write once, run everywhere system."
;)
jbailey: i couldn't agree more
no kidding
this looks interesting
wonder what kind of license
roby: i am not sure if i understand where the difference between this anygui and wxWindows is
i always thought wxWindows does exactly this
anygui supports curses
which is something we're trying to do in forms
reinhard: it seems that any-gui will load the gui toolkit that's available on the plateform
"this report your problem of managing different gui, like curses and wxwindows, leaving this to anygui"
ok
i would be curious how they do it with curses
"reinhard: ""DAMNIT, this STUPID windows !@#$ing toolkit!"""
I'll be quiet now =)
:)
they haven't done anything for curses now but they seems to plan something with interactive text based q&a mode
yeah i read that
not even curses but simple stdin/stdout
that's it
something like
please select field to change
fields available
1. name
2. street
3. zip
4. state
5. country
please select > 2
street > gnue road
1. update record
2. undo changes
please select >
or like that
Would you localize that?  (To say 3. Postal Code 4. Province in the case of locale==en_CA or such?)
sure
jbailey: i am the localization poliece for this project ;)
police
"reinhard: Excellent.  Americans seem to forget such things, so I'm glad GNUe's got someone."
don't forget ra3vat there
satisfying him is even harder than me
as i use iso-latin1 at least :)
Is he a UTF-8 guy?
cyrillic
not sure what character set he uses
or what encoding
we should have someone using traditional chinese ;)
Oh wow.
UTF-8 might be the best solution.
"I've been reading up on it, to try and learn what's the best way to do it.  I just cringe at having to use wchar_t's in my code."
I have to remember that Java's being a pig on strings is probably not the fault of the conversion to unicode internally.
"will i know a very small spattering of traditional chinese and might be able to test, provided i could use forms? :)"
argh! jcater what are you doing here?
neilt: that's easy!  forms doesn't require a datasource for testing
:)
"but i cant run wxPython, i think that might be a problem :("
ah
:(
buts its being worked on
anyone here remember (and play) Doom?
by others
so its just a matter of time
what platform you using?
"jamest: I remember getting very, very ill playing doom."
jcater_:  mac OS X
It has been released for my son's Game Boy Advance
I remember when friends of mine didn't have enough PC to run Doom full screen
and now a hand held can run what sounds like a basic port (w/o much optimizations)
Is there a chrystal reports type of deal being written for GNUe?
I'm not sure if your reporting is going to that extreme..
anybody home?
what is the sequence of calls to connect detail datasorce to master?
    ds=GDataSource()
    ds.setConnectionManager(self.connections)
    ds.database='pg'
    ds.type='object'
    ds.table='addressbook__country'
    ds.initialize()
    ds.connect()
    ds.referenceField("name")
    ds.referenceField("year_budget")
    ds.referenceField("id")
    ds1=GDataSource()
    ds1.setConnectionManager(self.connections)
    ds1.database='pg'
    ds1.type='object'
    ds1.table='addressbook__person'
    ds1.initialize()
    ds1.connect()
    ds1.referenceField("id")
    ds1.referenceField("name")
    ds1.referenceField("addr1")
    ds.masterlink="countrycode"
    ds.detaillink="id"
    ds.getDataObject().addDetailDataObject(ds1.getDataObject())
is not working
"DB000:   File ""/home/seva/src/gnue/.cvsdeveldir/gnue/common/dbdrivers/_dbsig/DBdriver.py"", line 244, in _createResultSet"
"DB000:     raise GDataObjects.ConnectionError, err"
DB000: gnue.common.GDataObjects.ConnectionError: error 'ERROR:  parser: parse error at or near "from"
"DB000: ' in 'SELECT id,name,year_budget, FROM addressbook__country'"
variants:
    ds1.masterlink="id"
    ds1.detaillink="countrycode"
    ds.getDataObject().addDetailDataObject(ds1.getDataObject())
and:
    ds1.masterlink="countrycode"
    ds1.detaillink="id"
do not work too 
"master table - addressbook__country, detail addressbook__person"
you coding something against the db drivers?
yes
postgresql 
"{'_fieldReferences': {'id': 1, 'name': 1, 'year_budget': 1, '': 1}, '_detailfields': [], '_masterObject': None, 'type': 'object', '_defaultValues': {}, 'table': 'addressbook__country', '_unboundFieldReferences': {}, '_detailObjects': [[<gnue/common/dbdrivers/postgresql/DBdriver.PG_DataObject_Object instance at 0x823d9cc>, None]], 'masterlink': '', 'detaillink': '', '_DatabaseError': <class pgdb.DatabaseError at 0x825a10c>, '_masterfields': [], '_resul"
detailfileds attribute does not get get
detailfileds attribute does not get set
hmmm
it works in forms
it not works in my code
you are not specifying ds.master
scratch that
the correct variant should be <sevik>     ds1.masterlink="id"
<sevik>     ds1.detaillink="countrycode"
<sevik>     ds.getDataObject().addDetailDataObject(ds1.getDataObject())
but I'm not sure why it's generating invalid SQL statements
current:
    ds1.referenceField("id")
    ds1.referenceField("name")
    ds1.referenceField("addr1")
    ds1.detaillink="countrycode"
    ds1.masterlink="id"
    ds.getDataObject().addDetailDataObject(ds1.getDataObject())
__dict__ of dataobject:
"{'_fieldReferences': {'id': 1, 'name': 1, 'year_budget': 1, '': 1}, '_detailfields': [], '_masterObject': None, 'type': 'object', '_defaultValues': {}, 'table': 'addressbook__country', '_unboundFieldReferences': {}, '_detailObjects': [[<gnue/common/dbdrivers/postgresql/DBdriver.PG_DataObject_Object instance at 0x823d9cc>, None]], 'masterlink': '', 'detaillink': '', '_DatabaseError': <class pgdb.DatabaseError at 0x825a10c>, '_masterfields': [], '_resul"
and the same error
'_masterfields': []
'_detailfields': []
is that ds._masterfields or ds1._masterfields?
ds
master
"i, found it"
ds1 - datasource
masterlinks/etc must by set for dataobject
"ah, yes"
"ok, it works"
"I think if those attributes are present in the datasource before the initialize(), then the initialize() copies those over"
"but if set after the initialize, the datasource doesn't know to transfer it"
    for attribute in tagAttributes.keys():
"      if hasattr(self, attribute):"
        self._dataObject.__dict__[attribute] = self.__dict__[attribute]
seems like that
"but as for me its not too logical, that you need to set some fileds, and call addDetailDataObject"
logically it must by parameters of addDetailDataObject method
"or call to addDetailDataObject must be done automatically on initialize, if masterlink/etc is set"
are you using cvs?
yes
hey are you guys letting that one dude do a GNUe Kernel Cousin?
sevik: actually we do need to move that call to the initialize area
i think so too
"currently, most of our tools don't use GDataSource directly, but subclass it... all of the subclassed GDataSources automatically handle this during init"
"but if it always happens, then it should happen at the most basic level :)"
I agree :))
forms has DataObjects too?
danielb: of course
"is that how triggers are supposed to work then, they are methods od the DataObjects becausre this would correlate wirh GEAS too then"
forms use GDataSource which has embedded DataSource
s/od/of
danielb: not exactly
forms use GDataSource which has embedded DataObject
"well I still wanna work on a library to do plugins for various languages, but for GEAS these methods are business object methods"
danielb: tcl first please :))
heh
python will be forst of course 
:P
:))
sevik: is TCL a big deal for you? 
I have to go back to being my old self
are you you being sarcastic?
jcater: I write most of scripts/etc in Tcl :))
I'm trying python for some days :))
is there a standard TCL library that can be easily linked to an application?
of course
does TCL support concept of "objects" (even if rudimentarily?)
rudimentary
the new glib is sexy though as it has GTypeModule to add new types and load then from dsos
BUT developer demand will dictate which languages get implemented quickest :)
but there are many pure tcl implementations of objects and some C extensions
"i.e., if we have someone helping with the project and they want TCL, then TCL will be high on the list :)"
itcl - official implementation
xotcl - my preffered :))
we just wanna share method and object code right?
"obviously, python will the the first trigger language (since we are in python :)"
"er, method and trigger"
doh
I'd think so
really tcl implemetation of obect very similar to pythons
sevik: what's special about xotcl?
object is simply array(tcl)/dictionary(python) and namespace for procedures
xotcl - dynamic loading/creating/destroing of classes
itcl - static
in xotcl you can redefine class at runtime
in itcl - you cant
"ah, cool"
I have working project on xotcl related to computer telephony
jamest: yesterday we decided we need a GNUe developer's conference
... in Vegas!
and there are impossible to shutdown service for reload :))
sevik: may I ask what you're coding w/ gnue-common?
jcater ;)
or at least the db drivers
jcater :)
jamest: you may not ask anything :P
you're not allowed
and obviously he's not talking :P
:)
btw chillywilly were you looking for free ldap?
olap
"ah, nevermind then"
someone asked about this on the FreeDevelopers list
hell I am not very sure what olap is only that masta tried to explain it to me one time
something to do with data warehousing
"well if masta explained it, it can't be good"
rofl
i'm back :))
i'm need working geas like server :))
"so, while i'm not to fluent with python, a started from more simple tasks :))"
related question - what is the status of geas dbdriver and perspektives for it to by working ?
heeeeey
um
er
:)))
"i haven't had time to work on it for about um, a month or so"
i hope to get a chance this weekend
ok :))
may be in some timei'll look at it too :))
about embedding of tcl:
        Tcl_FindExecutable(argv[0]);
        interp = Tcl_CreateInterp();
        if (Tcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
"                fprintf(stderr,""Tcl_Init failed"");"
                return -1;
        }
"        ends = Tcl_Merge(argc, argv);"
"       Tcl_SetVar(interp, ""argv"", Tcl_DStringValue(&argString), TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY"
); */
"        Tcl_SetVar(interp, ""argv"", ends, TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY);"
"        if (Tcl_EvalFile(interp,""init.tcl"") == TCL_ERROR) {"
"                Tcl_Eval(interp,""puts $errorInfo"");"
                return -1;
        };
it's all that you need for initialization
and simply:
"        sprintf(buffer,""something in tcl"");"
"        Tcl_Eval(interp, buffer);"
where you need executing of tcl
tcl has embedding in mind from begin
oh boy

re
hi mr
I must be doing something wrong with these kernel-image debs
Mr_You: why?
it complains about no root device.. even when I specify "root=/dev/hda1"
ick
I think I need to go to kernel compilers anonymous
kca
all I'm doing is apt-get install kernel-image-2.4.10-586
"I'm use to compiling the kernel, that has no problems, but I need kernel images"
make-kpkg
apt-get install kernel-package
lets you make a deb
well I figure I would just try whats available for now
don't need to build my own
ok
apt-get install kernel-image-foo
then add
do_initrd= yes  ]
to 
/etc/kernel-img.conf
then switch to /boot
and make sure /boot/initrd points to the initrd for the kernel image you installed
edit /etc/lilo.conf and add
yes to all
 initrd=/boot/initrd   
now
having said all that
hmm
the one in lilo.conf got removed
that initrd is under the specific image
not global
also
i have an Abit VH6-II here at work that kernel-image 2.4.10 refused to find the ide devices
thus it'd never find root
so I stuck w/ 2.2 on that system for now
i haven't tried 2.4.12 which was recently added 
do I need to do anything after editing lilo.conf?
yip
"maybe thats my problem, no ide devices"
with 2.4.10
here goes
wait
yeah
first make sure you've not screwed up lilo
I've got 
# Boot up Linux by default.
#
default=Linux
 
image=/vmlinuz
        label=Linux
        read-only
        initrd=/boot/initrd
as my first image
entry
then as root run lilo
lilo
so it installs the new config
then reboot
here goes
same thing it seems
I guess I'm having the same problem you were
you running 2.4.10?
trying ;-)
2.4.12 is available in woody
and might fix the issue
i haven't tried
it's easy to see if it's the problem though
as it never detects ide devices during a boot
blah
just make your own deb
might need to
"bah, who needs ide support"
real men use scsi :)
this from a man running diskless?
what's that make you?
:)
rofl
nuts?
heh
ltsp is about to do a 3.0 release :)
although I'm slightly perterbed in that I did a slackware install port and they didn't include it :(
"thats what I'm working towards, ltsp with woody"
sounds fun
roommate installed some creative labs software on XP and it hosed the system.. so he went back to 98/2000 .. heh.
he really wanted those special effects..
and extra toolbar
hi all
"heh, you should gte him using a Free OS Mr_You"
what is ltsp?
http://www.ltsp.org
the set of hacks :))
kewl'
jcater you use ltsp?
he does
yes I do
you csan run X too with ltsp?
"oh, yeah\"
we have ~40 X stations
courtesy of ltsp
at our callcenter
kewl
call center eh?
it is tres cool
yes
what does a call senter di dude?
s/di/do
"er, cente"
are

it's where all our telephone reps are located
we have a telemarketing group and a customer service group at the call center
it's 1-900's i think
ah ok
1-900-hot-geek or something
heh
1-900-4-a-geek
"course, that's better than 900-hot-goat"
:)
I just heard from madlocke
ok
he'll be back 4th of nov.
he's in russia now
back whre? ;-)
home
end
pg up
:)
"thanks jamest, it was the same problem you had"
jamest: where is he from?
brb changing computers
Mr_You: did 2.4.12 solve the problem?
yeah
I don't recall where madlocke is from
that 2.4.10 must be a bad image
Mr_You: madlocke is from germany
iirc from the former eastern part
ok cool
"he is from Augsburg, not sure what part is it"
oh
so i must have mixed up something
augsburg is bavaria - western part
l8r dudes
be back on line when I get home
"well, maybe it's not back up :)"
wotsat?
my internet
ah
how are you online now?
thought is was finally back up after 5 days
um
we have 40 ppl on a single dialup :)
LOL
that's gotta suck
that's an understatement :)
use a squid proxy cache ;-)
IRC and Email don't do too well w/cached data :)
"actually, we are using squid"
but more for its restrictive capacity than its caching :)
cool
you have dialup failover?
I remember discussing that with someone.. dunno if it was you
no
I just rigged a machine to act like our NAT and unplugged our BSD firewall from the network
ahh
"since it had the same IP address as the old firewall, it fit neatly into our network :)"
messy
but better than no service
yeah
jeff
Heya Daniel.
whaddup y'all?
"Hey chillywilly, why isn't commit-gnue listed on the mailing list page?"
uh oh
I dunno yell at  jamest one of these days
hi all
still working on a Kernal Cousins summary of the IRC logs
Excellent!
should have something ready to rumble by the end of the weekend
Biggest problem at the moment is that the KC format indexes on real names
I can get from IRC nick to e-mail address fairly easily
chillywilly's real name is "Penguin Boy" =)
but not necessarily to the name 
dude chillywilly is a penguin don't you know?
maybe he doesn't :-P heh
"hey, if it was easy, someone would have volunteered before"
psu: you the KC dude?
chillywilly is a cool penguin too
"oops, if I'd know it was trout time would have stayed clear"
Zack Brown is the head KC honcho
ok
psu: The nice part is that this channel seems to be full of regulars and people who show up once and don't say anything worth logging. =)
"yea, that name is familiar"
I'm just a lowly serf doing some KC stuff 
having been recruited by jailey
jbailey oops
"have no fear, penguin lord, thou shalt be in teh GNUE KCs "
probably all the time
even if I do have to cut all the trout slapping
doesn't really count as "development"
"(except for the trout, natch)"
some day I'll get around to doing it
really I will
I'd much rather do KC than hack code
but them IANAP (I am not a programmer)
There's an important place for both.
we are good to the non-programmers
porbably better than any other project
;)
"""In the free software wars, they also serve who only stand and document"""
psu: you could just ask ppl what their names are ;)
"psu: FWIW, I enjoy reading the KCs "
"yep, KCs are great"
aj - that would ruin all the fun...
hehe
"will do it as a last resort, but to be honest most people"
are trackable via e-mail address anyway.
big bruvver is watching heh heh
yeah
oh no :o
you don't wanna do that
well not if your nick is chillywilly
that could be an ... interesting google search
"yep, all the links on the first page for google are for me ;)"
http://www.mountainsummit.com/chillywilly/
rock on!
argh full of java applets
I need a t-shirt w/ chillywilly and  GNU on it
"anyway, I'm not mentioned until page 4 of 15 "
chillywilly: how close are you to toronto?
"screw tux man, I want chillywilly!"
ajmitch: way far  away
in Wisconsin
ok
site sucks cw ;-)
I know
is chillwilly.org taken?
but at least there's a picture of chillywilly
I dunno

man I gotta restart X
heh
brb
gotta go now
bye
where's that dsu guy go?
"er, where'd"
just left
"That's okay, if you say bad things about him he'll read it in the IRC logs. =)"
So be good. ;)
hehe
that damn dsu guy is such an M$ astro turfing beotch
eh?
I am joking
hello
can ajmitch come out and play?
excuse me?
is anybody home?
nope
all the rooms are vacant
damn
"ok, time to hack"
lol
why is that funny?
it just is :)
chillywilly: you can't fish-slapping in no one at home :) 
hehe
sure I can
I just leave it to rot at their door step then
(sigh)
midnight again
just spent 3 hours for a single bug
GNUe stuff?
missing sign in numerical output
no RealWork(tm)
:(
ouch
what di you hack on for RelWork(tm) reinhard?
"er, RealWork(tm)"
business software :)
well that's kinda broad
could you be more specific?
I think you told me once before
"accounting, invoicing, supplychain, stock management"
interesting
where did you learn all about that stuff?
for small & medium companies
learning by doing
especially learning by making mistakes :)
hehe
i have to get me some sleep
l8r all
'sup mdean?
me!  how goes it?
slowly
wassup ppl?
the usual
where's my masta?
dead channel ;)
isn't mdean alive and kickin'?
alive and twitchin'
too much caffiene?
weeeee

hi anybody
where can I see minimal client using dbdriver interface?
where can I see minimal client using dbdriver interface?
cvs
gnue/gnuef/samples/
"no, i mean python code "
I has wrote something
im not sure what you are asking
but question with master/detail
if you want to see something minimal that uses pygresql to access postgres w/ python but doesnt gnue-common
you can look in http://lxr.gnue.org/gnue/source/designer/GFDesigner-old.py
"no, I need somthing that uses gnue-common's datasourse/dataobject/etc interface"
ah
i guess im not sure what you are asking then
if you want to see simple examples of forms w/ database connections
look here http://lxr.gnue.org/gnue/source/gnuef/samples/
something like this:
    ds=GDataSource()
    ds.setConnectionManager(self.connections)
    ds.database='pg'
    ds.type='object'
    ds.table='addressbook__country'
    ds.initialize()
    ds.connect()
    ds.referenceField("name")
    ds.referenceField("year_budget")
are you doing that in a form?
...
"no, in python script"
or writing an application outside forms to do this?
"yes, standalone script without forms interface"
any reason you are not using forms?
i'm not need user interface :))
i'm trying to understand this interface
this == dataobject&co
designer uses some of this but not in context you want
it mostly does db introspection
if you look at http://lxr.gnue.org/gnue/source/designer/src/TemplateBase.py
at the top
it gets a list of all connections
and then all tables
and then schema of tables
then field data
in a series of functions
using common
but as i said not really what you are looking to do
i can do simple queries for one object
i need to do master/detail query 
ah
look here
http://lxr.gnue.org/gnue/source/reports/src/GRSources.py
er
http://lxr.gnue.org/gnue/source/reports/src/
this is the reports code
it uses common to access db
ok
looking...
it might help some
though its not a 'simple' little sample :)
ok :))
"when jcater gets here ask him to write you something that connects to db, queries a table and prints the records to screen"
he shoudl be able to do so in a matter of minutes
im getting ready to go out door to vacation or i would :)
this sample i already done myself :))
neilt: hello
hello
just responded to andrewm's email
ok i read it
and i must say i couldn't agree more
:)
no kidding
we have quality of design
which may be good or bad but that doesn't matter in that respect
because quality of implementation is another cup of tea
and is mostly independent of the design
you write good code to prove the design wrong if needed
anyway
:)
i now have some tasks to do for the next week again :)
--
you ever heard something about the swiss article thing lately?
yes
"i forwarded to you, i have not had time to look at the edits"
just right now?
but the email just came yesterday
yes sending now
ok already got it
Also inform Francois if Neil Tiffin "neilt@gnue.org" is _not_ the official
email address that you'd like to be published.
shall we publish neilt@gnue.org?
or better info@gnue.org?
info@gnue.org
is better
ok
neilt: are you going to write answer?
ok
you should have answer
yep thanks
bbl
jcater!
our internet connection at work has been down since friday!!
and my home cable connection has been intermittent
!!!!
"hey jcater, jamest"
hey
bummer
"I got my box booted up with the latest woody rescue disk, but drivers are botched, gettin there heh"
your woody comes on a disk?
"wow, linux is pretty darned cool :)"
hehe
heh
good thing I have kernel source ;-)
Mr_You i should hope you have full access to your woody ;)
man
I leave for a week
(or three)
well we are goat depraved of late
heh
so what do you expect
and you guys stop talking about goats and start talking about woody
well im off to disneyland 
see you folks on sunday night
bye bye

and goats
and camels
especially the goats
and snakes
hey hey
it's the monkeys
hmm
why am I already logged in?
and ppl say we monkey around
but we're too busy singing
to put anybody down
cause you have a clone() implemented :P
you know of any good personal finance apps besides gnucash
it is missing some critical features
I guess I'll have to stick w/MS Money :(
what is gnucash missing?
budgeting and recurring transactions
"uh, yea what you said"
I actually wouldn't mind a commercial personal finance package for linux if there was one
that's all I have left tying me to Win32 at home
"then just wait it out for gnucash man, they hack a lot on it"
it always comes in second to evolution in the cvs commits on the gnome summaries
they must beworking on soemthing
are those features planned?
do you know?
dunno
what good are you then
:P
ask dres__
he's a gnucash guy ya know
I'm going to be in and out
"if you see him around, can you ask him about those 2"
please
pretty please
:)
"uh, maybe"
:P
ello mdean
howdy!
'sup
jcater: elho
danielb: hi
howdy
dtm: my status?
"yeah, at least you're present"
how's it going
fine
yay
"well you just keep being fine for me, dan"
"i'm going to make some generic tuna helper, ok?"
geezz air tickets and hotel deals are CHEAP!
really?
where ya looking>
?
was on the news
packages to Vegas and one-way tickets
and Mexico
well this isn't really new tough
though
you can fly anywhere for dirt cheap right now
"news to me, I don't fly anywhere"
well most airlines cannot pay their bills
right now
yeah
they are getting gov't assistance
what are some of the good online ticket sites?
I know travelocity
orbitz
priceline.com
someone needs to have an expo or something now that I can afford to go ;)
lol
we need a gnue developers conference :)
in vegas :)
there ya go :)
you can wi your trip money to go back
:P
"er, win"
more like lose your dinner money :)
hehe
"jcater: budgeting and scheduled transactions are currently being worked on (sched has code, budget has design).  No time frame for completion though."
dres: cool
scheduling is most important
:)
hi
hi psu
hi aj
just doing the morning mail-drop
thought I'd check in
& see what chillywilly's been saying about me
in my absence ;-)
how's KC GNUe going? ;)
Spent about an hour on it last night
cool
got all of three IRC "threads" summarised
chillywilly wasn't too nasty ;)
ok
the day I worry about abuse from cw 
is the day I have a severe sense of humour failure
haha
d'you think he reads the back logs too?
I suspect I may be summarising too much
three short paras for 4 days' logs
dunno
where are the logs again?
but I can't really count trout-slapping as "development discussions"
i just leave xchat connected all the time & read stuff in the morning if i feel like it ;)
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/
haha
i gotta help out with GNUe soon...
i've lurked here too long w/o helping ;)
I wanted to do something - jumped at the KCs when it was suggested
i'm more of a developer
i suck at writing stuff like docs ;)
The most ambitious "programming" I've ever done is some simple SQL select/update
doesn't really count
heh
Do people still describe themselves as "HTML Programmers"?
And do they still get flamed for it?
unfortunately some people do
and they still get flamed; )
probably deserve it
hehe
i'm an html programmer - i use python to make html pages ;)
I'm going to get some official training at work on writing web pages
so I can put internal project docs on the intranet
http://ajmitch.dhis.org/dotgnu/
a far better looking irc logs page :)
that should be a laugh ... been writing HTML since 1995
heh
the hard way - in text editors
i guess i have been as well
"text editors are the best way to do it, especially if you're a programmer ;)"
(cue Monty Python "got up in the middle of the night..." joke)
"To be fair, I do need to be told about corporate templates, approval procedures, etc. etc."
yeah
all the stuff I don't have to worry about 
for personal pages
aj - that's one fine looking irc logs page
i'm the sort of person that writes those templates & stuff for personal pages :)
psu: a simple python hack
i wrote a script for making directory listings
interesting - your logs are pure text
gnue ones are HTML
yep
not sure which I prefer - doesn't make much difference I suppose
"they're just dumped out by eggdrop, the irc bot"
not as if the gnue ones are particularly formatted
couldn't be bothered writing something to htmlize them ;)
fair enough
"I am a fairy. My name is Nuff. Fairy Nuff."
i might
heh
I did suggest 
jigging the HTML log files 
the gnue logs look like plain text to me
oops 
you're night.
right even
think i should make mine into html logfiles?
only reason I can think off
is if you are going to put extra hrefs if
nah
e.g. on the gnue logs
"if we put an <a name = ""001"">, <a name = ""002""> every 20 lines"
yeah
it'd mean I could hyperlink from Kernel Cousins to specific parts of the log
rather than just the whole day
"Frankly, I'm not sure it's worth it"
that'd be easy enough to do
I will try to include a real quote from each point anyway
just a cgi script that wraps the actual logfiles
and people can use their Find function in their favourite browser to go right to it
even with a <a name = "nnn"> every 20 lines 
"and returns the text with it wrapped in html sugar, and having <a> tags interspersed"
i'm still unlikely to hit the first line of a discussion exactly
(even assuming you can tell where something as 
nebulous as an "IRC thread" starts)
aj - you could put in "cute" icons every time someone gets netsplit ;-)
psu: haha
anyway gotta go now
earn a crust
cu l8ter
k ;)
bye
hi
ajmitch: how are things in .nz
hi
boring ;)
oh?
whyzat
at the moment - wet
dontcha got no stuff blowin up er nuthin?
"dtm: yeah, i'm meant to be studying for exams"
nah
nz is such a boring place to be ;)
how's your stuff going?
but
i watched the movie "once were warriors"
and it was very exciting
and sickening
"heh, yeah, it is a bit like that"
"terrifyingly violent, etc"
"dysfunctional, etc"
aren't you that way?
do you live in a car?
nope ;)
just chekcing
"oh , ok"
i can dig it
are you from a tribe?
coz that would be awesome.
with tattoos and stuf.f
i live in a closet
i should get some of those.
"nope, i'm of european descent"
ajmitch: can I be in your trib eplease?  does your tribe have a url?
please?
i got a friend who's samoan - he's got tatoos on about a third of his body ;)
dtm: uhmm....
dtm: sorry ;)
puhleez.
ok
that's cool
is he in your tribe
i found a book with pictures of your people in it
well they're from some island.
and they have huge breasts
most of them
lots of tattoos 
my people?
very dark
yeah from your tribe
heheh
with the body art
very offended about the "white people"
"killing them, stealing their trademarks, etc"
very big problem.
very rude.
thou shalt not coveteth thine tribal neighbors' IP
i sgeas really thread safe?
wassup?
anyine home?
"er, anyone even"
"so, can I create thread in geas, and do periodically somethiins usefull ?"
in python i mean
er?
GEAS is single threaded right now
so better compile python without thread module?
hey andru
geas is not thread-safe
hello
morning
how are you?
is this the andru I think it is
yyip
have you been in channel lately and I not notice?
No
or you just stopping by?
not really
ah
just stopped by
i saw a link to forms so popped in
have you looked at the work neilt and reinhard have been pouring into geas?
damn internet will lead you everywhere
lol
"nah, iy just leads you to porn sites :P"
i saw version 0.0.6 realeas but i havn't checked out code
s/iy/it
still coding hard jamest?
hardly coding actually
why not?.
slacker
I'm hoping to get back in this weekend 
who said you could stop coding?
"time.  I've got 2 jobs, going to school, and taking taekwondo"
i returned to coding a couple of months ago. got a bunch of young people to do my other jobs
:)
you still working on a UI for geas
?
kindaof
the geas driver is my current forms project
I got got sick of ges so restart writing bits of it
really
geas not ges there
Yeah it wasn't fast and was doing bizare things to my records.
you ought to look at geas in cvs
So i started replacing parts in it
it's had major overhauls (from my understanding)
it still doesn't some really odd shit (pardon my french)
but that stuff is on the todo list
yeah.
doesn't = does
geas sucks
:P
"see chillywilly, it's ok for you to say that as you put code into it IIRC"
"I dont actually have much geas code left , as i kept writing stuff over a month or so"
and at the end of the month it wasn't much around anymore
you still doing objectserver stuff?
or 2-tier
or other
kinda 2-teir
Its 2-teir but with an OO wrapper
it could easily be made 3-teir but i need performace and stablitiy so ignored 3tier for moment
its about 4000 times faster than geas
and it doesn't shag my data
i was consdiering putting up a project for it tongith
i think the major issues w/ geas (in my limited tested) was the use of temporary tables while building query structures
seemed like major overkill
debating wether the open source commiunty really needs another database wraper
but i've been out of touch for about 6 months
"er, weeks"
andru do you have a copy of the ODMG book/spec?
so they may have fixed that
jamest: yeah i really hate the temporary tables use. told andrewm not to use them when he was working on it but he did it anyway. grr
:)
chillywilly: i dont own books that are less than a hundred years old
andru: you coding in C still?
Yes
and nothing else
yes he cares about performance :P
though i'm thinking of using or developing a lisp langauge for some of this lanaguge genration stuff i'm playing with
I think a python app server would be worse than the current geas
well should i release another database wrapper libary for linux?
gnu/linux
quite your whinning chillywilly and answer the question
no one is whining
andru you have a db abstraction layer?
yes
bring it on then :P
and it can be slid in as a straight replacement for geas
I don't see how that can be a db abstraction layer is not an app server
"You let the database be the server, the libary plugs in where geas was on the client end"
that's a fat client then
exactly
and you have the same code in every client
but i dont mind have a 3mb libary on every client
well we hav talked about downloadbale methods and having some fat client functionality too
"er, downloadable"
andru: but what abount thin clients and forcing business rules in server?
nothing?
nothing at all.
ssh i'm not here.
blah
thin clients rock
what is the sense of yet another database abstraction ?
doean't matter though as we're probablyt gonna have noth wsays to do it....well we sorta do anyway
s/noth/noth
damn
it is hard to type standing up
:P
"well there's an OO db stabdard, and a relational db stabdard that ppl only half use"
ODBC is supposed tobe a standard
and going that way you forcing all client applicatin to be in one language..
how is ODBC tieing you to one language?
wassup dude?
not odbc :)) loading methods in client
oh my god
andru is back
;)
reinhard: he was just stopping by
seems he scraped geas and recoded it :(
he has a new geas API compatible thing 
http://bond.treshna.com
has a UI generator as well 
well
"there is good in that news, too"
at least we can now be 100% sure that breaking compatibility will be no problem in geas
:)
"bond is not UI generator as I understand, it's a db binder to gladegenerated UI"
chillywilly: I strongly disagree that a python geas would be slower than current C!!!
later
"sevik: sorry, i had private talk w/ andru about ""old times"""
and he claimed to still be working on his UI thing
which IIRC translated xml into hard coded C interfaces
i thought that was talked about in main channel but I see now it wasn't :)
quote from bond.thresna.com:
GnomeDB will probably be added. Within postgresql you can create views to your tables that describe the fields you want on a window form. This is then picked up by BOND and translated into information to work out which widgets are data-aware and what their data source is. Vies also need to be created in postgresql to define the relationships between objects. BOND will only work with postgresql version 7.0 and 
so it not stores meta information
it works on plain one table selects/updates/etc
it's postgresql only?
according to site - yes
ouch
oh yeah that's cool
a database abstraction layer that only understands postgres
:)
"as i understand - main task of bond - binding widgets to fields in db, and automatically providing standart functions like search/add/modify"
something like gnuef in its current 2tier state but in C
"ah, then that is his UI thing of old"
i prefer gnuef :)
"grrr, source tarball contains compiled objects/binaries/etc"
the current geas is crap just so you know anything wil be faster than it
plus the whole caching design is lame as hell
you need multiple caches
my OO design bok has a much better design in it
s/bok/book
I am gonna buy the friggin odmg book this week I think
I'll photo copy it and mail it to whoever wants it
we should switch to GObject in the development glib
I bet libGDA isn't ODMG compliant what Gnome should use is a an ODMG GObject mapping
reinhard I think the parser internal stuctures should alos use GObject system as I think you can add methods and shit to GObjects on the fly which would be pretty cool
jamest you here?
jamest could you install gnu emacs 21 on ash?
I think that package is in testing now
uh oh
we're being watched now
chillywilly: :))
psu you are using winblows?
fraid so
usual excuse - I need MS Office
(the GNU equivalent of "I only read Playboy for the articles" I know...
you need M$ office like you need a hole in the head
:P
chillywilly: Have you considered life *without* any holes in your head?
hey jeff
jbailey I meant an extra one....some of those holes you need to have there
"some".  I don't think I have a spare one right now -I'll keep you posted.
I can function with one eye
anyway...
Depth perseption would be all wacked.
whatever man
you need all the natural holes in your head
but you don't need an extra one
is that good engouh?
enough even

chillywilly: you should be working ;)
"uh, no"
I am working
damnit
soeone has to sit at the panel

hehe
sounds like a hard job
well I took the ladder and gathered and put back the freakin smoke detectors on the 2nd fllor

"hmm this image works fine, but pcmcia modules aren't"
and strangely many including my messages from Oct on kde::enterprise mailing list are gone from the archives
must have dumped them
it's a conspiracy
you bet
they wanna remove GNU
kde bastards
and this is the desktop you all choose to run?
what's your problem w/kde
at least it's GPL
:)
and not LGPL :)
so is a ot of Gnome
plz
do me a favor
"last I checked, gnome was mostly lgpl"
go to #kde and say hey man isn't the GPL awesome
heh
lol
"go to #gnome and say ""hey, why don't we make it non-techie user friendly"""
it is getting there...KDE had a head start
what do you expect?
QT is dual licensed so that's even worse at least you cannot use GTK+ code but you can link to it....however if I pay trolltech some money I can take away all the freedoms
how is that any better or worse?
I don't see how that takes away any freedom wrt KDE...seems like the same situation w/gtk
how do you figure?
"usually w/my fingers and toes, but occasionally w/a calculator"

heh
wassup?

"nah, it is an illusion"
you can wake up now

I can't tell the difference
:)
jcater: kdelibs is not gpl'd
it is not all gpl'd
gah
you ppl are sickening
oops wrong channel
hmmmm - and I guess Mono is a good thing?
mdean: depends on how much you enjoyed getting it :)
heh
dotgnu is a good thing....mono would a good thing too if they would know how to cooperate but I hate ximian as much as I hate kde
i got it from a water bottle on my basketball team....
mdean: is that a .rr.com I see??? you finally get your broadband?
jcater: i already port scanned him to see if i could hack in and steal his bandwidth
finally - the reaches of digital have finally extended to the boonies
jamest_: is that really you?
damn
guess not
"yes, it's me"
another kde traitor
"chillywilly: um, give it up.. you're outnumbered by a large margin :)"
s/traitor/lover
whore
no closet-kde lovin here :)
KDE is really swell!
you're all trolltech whores now
give all your code to trolltech
no
NOW
we're trolltech bitches
pimp that gpl'd qt to to me baby!
there's a difference
KDevelop rocks too
"that vile, evil gpl'd code"
big deal
"go through an count all the gnome libs, kde libs, and apps and it will be a wash anyway"
I know several kde developers who detest the gpl just as much
got o #kde
s/o/to
it's loaded with them
as much as ximian hates the term free software?
they probably bitched and moaned when QT went GPL
ximian ia not gnome....does redhat hat the gpl?
chillywilly: trolltech is not kde :)
ximian can kiss my ass
just admit it you do not wanna support GNU when it does not suit you ;)
GObject should make the dependencies less painful
chillywilly: turn that around :)
KDE 2.0 was a complete rewrite
jcater: I am using a GNU desktop how about you?
I'm using a solid oak desktop w/a computer with GPL'd/free fillings
where my kde forms frontend damnit?
"whoops, wrong button"
hehe
jamest_: wb
why don't you leyt me have ops and I can show the kde kid something
i have a confession to make
i use microsoft word
and excel
.... regularly
gasp!
heretic!
infidel!
you will die now!
:P
run Maniac
a heretic is just someone whose ideas haven't been accepted by the blind public
no one expects the gnu inquisition
a genius
even
i work in excel while listening to britney spears......
javaguy: you a kde whore now too?
mdean: does dcl export to microsoft project?
oh good
wanda is kewl 
;)
chillywilly: put that battle aside and choose another ;-)
Mr_You: shutup
Maniac: it creates a tab delimited file for consumption by any M$ office product
"when GTK and KDE are in widespread use, bring it back out"
mdean: really?
how do you do that?
jcater: do a search and look at the drop down box in the results
duh!
I knew that
:)
jcater: cmon that was an easy one :)
"mdean: I know you are an M$ whore by day, but I'd rather fricking starve"
i can one-up mdean
just not GNUe
...or is setting up my ignore file considered coding?
"are you ready? i use MS Office Suite, Borland delphi, interbase (NOT opensource), win2kpro and ... Filemaker 5.5 @ work"
"oh, yeah"
thats too bad maniac
Maniac: sucks to be you
"oh, forgot IE 6.0 <--- the best browser yet!"
damn I have too many debs to download
"uh, no"
I work with developers who snicker at the W3C DOM standard - all I want is for our product to support Mozilla!
oops
heh
mdean: what's wrong with the DOM?
can you apt-get from Microsoft?
rpm -Uvh Win2kSP2.exe
"Maniac: you should replace them all with gdbm, vi, oleo, and the hurd"
chillywilly: they think it's funny (or maybe cute) that I want to use DOM so both browsers are supported
^-- that bombed for some reason --^
you said those two words inthe same sentence!
apt-get this (780987&)(*&)(*&
"Maniac: sure, it's called ""Hey apt, get me that damn MS cd"""
blasphemy!
jcater: LOL
mdean: they only want you to support M$
mdean: you should set them straight
chillywilly: ja - I'm trying
cause they're all SAGPL'd (Socially acceptable gnu public license) software
chillywilly: I wrote a drag and drop layout editor for real estate listings using the DOM
I will leave old kde alone
chillywilly: most of it works in Mozilla too
kde is ok....I just don't like it
:)
btw Maniac I'm joking of course
hmm
I'm a steenking solaris user
psu:  this discussing doesn't need summarization :)
jamest_: sokay
psu: summarize NOW!!! or die!!!
killall everybody
kill -9 jcater
mv chillywilly /dev/null
mv /dev/null chillywilly
cat jcater /dev/null
cat chillywilly 
oops
cat jcater > /dev/null
cat chillywilly | grep 'a clue'
Maniac: I live here I can act like an ass if I want to
lol
Maniac: you just have to deal with it or get the fsck out
:P
chillywilly: i'm a visitor seriously cruisin for a bruisin
eveyone loves to get their daily trout shippings
"er, whippings I mean"
although....
you boys better keep checking your mailboxes
and here i thought you were going to ship me some trout
;)
chillywilly: i can be reached at maniac@tryandemailme.com
jcater: I need to ship you "How Not to Marry My Sister Event Though I Live in the South" ;)
and "I Do Really Own A Pair of Shoes?"
chillywilly: How to Win Firends and Influence People
jamest_: Calculus Made Easy
derek: Raising Goats for Profit
jamest_ I can help you with claculus
"er, calculus I mean"
the answer is the first derivative ;)
weeee
does xchat run on windows?
they make engineers take lots of friggin calculus
Maniac: not for you :P
jcater: and don't forget "My Cousin is Not Sexy"
"Maniac: sure... but when you are booting up, you need to press l i n u x <enter>"
and it will boot w/gnome support :)
chillywilly: he is too
chillywilly: cool
tell me then
plz read that book jc
yes?
now the integration of sin x cos x dx  
is supposed to be
use substitution :P
it makes it easier
shit man I would have to dig out my book
1/2 (sin^2 x)+c
:)
I don't have those memorized anymore
I use the front cover of the book :P
as the solutions guide (the book they want you to buy to help you) says that is the answer but we've not worked one like this before
and they of course have in the guide initial problem = answer
hmmmmm
well
w/o one damn trace of the logic to get from point b from a
you = sin x
damn xchat
i = sin lots
u=sin x
roflmao
du=oh I know
woops
oh I know
use the product rule
d/dx[uv] = uv' + vu'
derivative of the first times derivative of the second
er sorry
first times derivative of the second
+ second times derivative of the first
then you probably gotta do some hairy ass trig identities to reduce it though
lemme see...
but i have the derivative now
and I'm integratring
it's ok
uh duh
intergation
I knew that
doh
they teach you substitution?
'u du' crap
u=cos x
er wait
u=sin x
du cos x dx
du=cos x dx
so then it is
yip
I[u du]
= 1/2 u^2
substitute you
'u'
back in
1/2 sin^2 x +C
get it?
hey man
maybe
I am damn proud of myself for remembering that
;)
lemme perculate for a sec
you basically look at the function and try to identify a function and its derivative
id you can do that you can make it into a simple 'u du' form
s/id/if
since
d/dx sin u=cos u du
(derivative of sine == cosine)
argh!
"stoopid, stoopid, stoopid jamest"
you can rewrite the integral
sorry
trig identity states: sin 2x = sin x cos x
makes the whole problem much much easier :)
yea
that's easy too
won't always fit a nice identity
nope
wait unti you do integration by parts
;)
until
those are the hariest integrals
they don't even fit any forms....bsaically it is th elast resort to do integration by parts
thing I hate about math is if you miss one little thing you can screw the whole problem up
there's more than one thing I hate about math :)
heheh
"calculus I, II, III, IV, and differential equations"
but I always got As
math rox
anyway
jamest_: you can email me questions too if I am not around at chillywilly@gnue.org or danielb@freedevelopers.net....I probably didn't mention it bu junior and senior year I tutored all math classes for the TRIO program
mwahahaha
and CS courses too :P
I like teaching ;)
"chillywilly: cool, I'll keep that in mind"
=)
mb mdean
thanks - installed Ximian desktop so I can run the latest xchat in kde
i suppose you're not using debian either?
Mandark
you are just a naughty Free Software guy
:)
man I think the new debian installer and hadrware detection thingy will kick ass
they are rollong progeny's stuff into debian
new installer?  it needed one!
rolling
cool
"blah, you shouldn't install gnu/linux if you don't know what you are doing ;)"
j/k
"er, buddy"
I tried 1.3 - didn't care for the install
1.3 is ancient
this was around '98 or '99
do you use urpmi?
not directly
I was dialup until today
well didn't you like apt?
so updating packages wasn't my priority
"truthfully, I didn't get it installed - didn't feel I needed to configure the services at install time"
over dialup
:P
ouch
configure services at install time?
"yes - maybe it was a bad install selection I made, but it was asking all kinds of questions to configure the services"
any word on when they are rolling in Progeny stuff?
man I was whipping through my buddies install.....I can now say I am a master debian installer ;)
I dunno
probably for woody release
I used to be that way with Slackware
;)
used to? slack 8 rox my world :)
debian should get releases out faster
now that they have package pools and 3 distros
man I am gonna gte a DSL connection soon
get
"mmmmm, nutty bars are way better then krispy kreme"
;)
gasp!
hehe
j/k

kkk
haha
thanks for the help chillywilly
i'm out of here
redhat can pay me to hack on GNUe
that's the ticket ;)
damn I dun figured it all ou
out
this puter in the closet warms the room nicely with the door open
My den in the old place was like that.  3 computers.  toasty warm.
chillywilly: HIGH
mdean-zZzZ: oooh   mdean's always on1
!
mdean-zZzZ: ^5
for those that are interested: http://sourceforge.net/projects/compiere/
HI ALL
HI DTM
ajmitch: hi
wassup?
"ajmitch: jcater pointed out compiere to me earlier, interesting competition, similar to www.possl.org"
howdy
hello
hello
goodby
goodbye
lol
what a poetic group we are
 
hi all
  to you too :)
is  russian for hi?
:)
"yeah, wrong layout"
hi Isomer 
jcater you around?
yip
mornin' :)
no
users are expecting me to work today
"btw, I'll be at a Tom Peters seminar tomorrow"
so don't expect to see me until late PM
Tom Peters?
yeah.. one of those management gurus
"happy, happy, joy, joy"
tom peters sounds more like a porn stars name than management guru
heh
jcater procuring booth now for LWCE
"before its too late, if we have to back out we have to back out, but want to preserve it"
ok
"Isomer any comments, questions, flames?"
My biggest comment is that I think it's a good idea :)
jcater i faxed over info for booth and have contacted IBM about machines (as well as development goodies for db2)
It's somewhat disconcerting with the nicknames after the reference to the person
I would have used something like Real Name (alias) [*]
and made the alias "part" of their realname
?
or done Real "alias" Name :)
but thats only cosmetic :)
say my name is Derek Neighbors and irc nick is dneighbo
how would you represent it? and how is it represented now (me shamefully doesnt know) ;)
so Derek "dneighbo" Neighbors
psu does these so will pass this on to him as now looking at the KC i remember not being in love with that either
that would be on idea yeah
"also, nowhere on the page (that I could see) did it mention the network or the channel name"
doh!
which is kinda important if you want people to turn up :)
that is a major boo boo :)
"(on the other hand, the logs are enlightening :)"
*** NOTE TO PSU PLEASE ADD CHANNEL LOCATION TO KC's ****
huh?
Reinhard "reinhard" Mller
:)
you need your irc name more encripted :)
Jason "pimpdaddy" Cater
morning all :)
mornin' mitch
LTNS
yeah
"oh, hi chillywilly"
:)
hey dudes
Isomer: what drags you in here? :)
whatcha doin' here Isomer?
jinx
hehe
double entry accounting crap
it is confusing
nah
or maybe I am just slow
either way it sux
heh
chillywilly: read the kt this morning
so I thought I'd drop in
and make a few minor comments
and generally just sit and talk :)
kernel cousin?
yeah
oooh
the world needs more of them
yep we are now officially being watched
"hmm, it doesn't help that the website or irc server are not mentioned..."
ajmitch: ?
nor does it explain what GNUe is :)
on the KC
ok
"ah no, i see the website link"
complain to psu when he comes around
reinhard has already put his note in the logs :)
that is the same summary as last time right?
there's nothign new is there?
yes
"yes, what?"
but it's linked from linuxtoday.com now
oooooh
kewl
so more people will see it
uhuh
no comments though
:(
more people will see your name...
ah well
add a comment then!
oh crud
"bah, there's nothing I wanna comment on"
hehe
rofl
"you can say how you love GNUe, it's the best thing since sliced bread..."
or we could get Isomer here to comment.... :)
"hmm, i think i got up a little late today..."
scorpio?
yip
you too?
no wonder we argue so much
rofl
so we gonna have a big irc party for them?
my b-days next month 
Isomer: you
Isomer: you're in june as well?
May
k
it's nearly lunch time :P
what are fixed assets?
anyone?
"Isomer: yeah, but i just got up :)"
you finally sleep ajmitch?
:P
"chillywilly: from my very very vague memory of doing accounting like 8 years ago, I *think* it's things like buildings"
"chillywilly: yeah, decided to go to bed about 3am this morning"
after not sleeping the other day?
Isomer: k
yeah
sigh
"after 2 weeks, I finally have X over Windows :)"
jcater: VNC!
why do you want that?
man I cannot click in the opening balance text box
wtf
nevermind
new version of cygwin is out
gah why are there so many more expenses than income categories?
hehe
coz noone has enough money :)
damn'
;)
"Isomer: actually, use it daily :)"
"President Bush signed an executive order Thursday night allowing either the White House or former presidents to veto release of their presidential papers, drawing criticism from President Clinton and several historians. "
would you expect any less from him?
its his people
"he's just a pen pusher, face and voice"
what do the "presidential papers" contain?
"Many officials of the Regan and first Bush administration are back in the White House, and critics contend that the executive order may be motivated by a desire to protect them."
"The order reinterprets the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which put papers of future presidents in the public domain, following a court fight over Richard Nixon's papers"
.
heh
"Gonzales said any decision to withhold documents could be challenged in court, adding that the administration would lose if a decision did not have solid constitutional grounding. He acknowledged that such a process could take years. "
nite all
I think I really hate republicans
atleast the recent ones
I hate both parties
they are both bought
I bid too much on a used book heh
hrrmmm wget is not excluding 
nondescrimintary unix tools
lol
so I can idle in more interesting places like this :)
:)
we have our spurts
I'll walk away for 5 minutes (after 1 hr of no activity) and have to scroll back several pages :)
mdean: 'sup dawg?
hey d00d
yo mdean
(& jcater)
howdy
can you get gnuebot to put the occasional <a name="ts"> into the channel logs?
so you can put the links on the KC page to go direct to the start of the conversation?
instead of whatever was happening at midnight or so? :)
"the Gnu enterprise forms thingie renders using GTK, Win32, Curses etc, is there a HTML frontend?"
it's in the works
but we don't have a functioning version available yet
ahh cool
jcater: got a quick ? for ya
wassup
jcater: would PyDO make sense in GNUe?  or is it not needed?
um
what's PyDO?
Python Data Objects
http://skunkweb.sourceforge.net/pydo.html
interesting
very interesting
what's funny is that's what I did with the DCL db classes somewhat
define fields and types in the constructor and let the db base class worry about persistence
can you tell what the license is on that puppy?
"heh, funky."
jcater: GPL
cool
and we tend to use that a lot
another group uses Oracle Forms and curses it regularly
:)
that's my background
yeeesh
only I refused to give up Form 3.0 (the last curses based forms)
heh
"until Oracle pried if from my cold, hard hands"
sounds like them
rofl
that's why I'm here :)
I've never used oracle forms
"so, shrug :)"
What backend do you guys recommend?
postgresql
ditto
pgsql wrox
we work with all major backends
but of course we must recommend a free one :)
and pgsql IMHO is the best of the free ones
for this type of stuff
defintely
definitely even
Good
if you said mysql
postgres is the shiznit
I'd have to shoot you
:)
lol
mysql is good if you want to run sql queries against your file system
"well, IMHO, a relational database that doesn't do transactions needs to grow up :)"
jcater: subselects is another screaming problem
yes
there are many issues :)
"you don't need them often, but when you do...."
and foreign keys
yes!
but hey - they're manual says you don't need that stuff if you write your application properly
feh!
"although, have you ever seen phpmyadmin?"
ja
mdean: who cares? it's documention.  Documentation is important
and PgAdmin
seen the recent cvs versions?
nope
bleeding edge phpmyadmin is very sweet :)
hmm
I steer clear of mysql if at all possible
mysql gives me hives
I'm forced to use it at work
my condolences
but I must say whoevers working on phpmyadmin is doing something right
chillywilly: I thought that was gnome
I like what I've seen of TOra so far
"oh, wait.. the rash is from gnome"
hehe
"bah, if I wanted winders on GNU/Linux I would just yse KDE"
s/yse/use
rofl
but KDE pre-1.0 alpha was much more stable than Vinders
or wine? :)
Gnome ownz
heh - wine progman.exe takes me back...
Gnome is a hackers desktop
imho
desktop?
hackers have desktop?
yep it is called Gnome
heheh
bah
real hackers use X to multiplex xterms!
real hackers don't get out enough to even know what a trout is
but the web doesn't look good in the console
jcater: thems fighting words
whats a web?
"ok, Isorms"
jcater: thats 'virtual trout'
"bah, somtimes I dfo hangout in #prosapologian where they all use winblows"
that's why I use the trout....I was actaully making fun on mIRC you know
s/was/am
Oww!
chillywilly: please keep your trouts to yourself
jcater: make me
especially if you are wildly slapping it
I dare you
"wildly, salpping"
duh
there's a pause there
"er, slapping"
derek: you use gnucash to track your finances?
brb
derek: I think we need a solid (few paragraph) description of GNUe on home page
we need a new homepage
"i hate to say that, but after much thinking i think they need to be separate, i was torn before on this, but figured we would try the slashdot thing"
"i think we need a simple site, like the one you originally mocked up"
I've heard over and over that no one understood our porject after looking at our home page
that is very clean
jcater: precisely
basic announcements of releases as 'news items'
maybe we need a www.gnue.org and a my.gnue.org :)
I think I only "got" it coz I knew what oracle forms was all about
then have tools section
packages section
but much cleaner
and simple
I have a working blurb:
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/blurb.html
i think there is still HUGE value in a 'business news site' that is concentrated on free software
ie. a free software business portal
derek: I don't disagree at all
but i think they need to be separate
"i ahve always somewhat thought that, but figured we could give this a try"
"well, I was part of this design too :)"
"but I must say, it isn't working"
"or, alternatively, have a big button somewhere saying ""what is GNUe all about?"""
(I can say that since I helped do it :)
jcater i agree i think the idea is right and if everyone knew what gnue was it woudl be more efficent (i.e. sap could probably get away with it)
but since most people want to find out 'what is gnue'
and easily find the 'basics' i think we need a more simple site
I know
i have to go shopping  :( (sigh free days are toast lately)
but at least a one page summary with a link near the top of our home page
is a necessity
and considering buying new car tonight (double sigh)
ack!!
jcater: part of me says the current site would work if we could 'fix some of it'
i hate how some of the 'nuke' navigation comes first on left side (i tried to get rid of it and couldnt)
if packages / tools was up there it would more clear i think
"well, I'm not voting for a completely new site"
we don't have the resources
also better stuff on the top nav bar (more direct stuff)
and then a header of WHAT GNUe is 
but we have a specific problem that we should be able to solve short term
before any of the articles
I only bring this up as 
we will be releasing again soon
I gotta run to the store
i have to run to store too
hmm
noones done a gnome summary for a few weeks :/
"jcTarget: you said that the HTML version was under development, how complete is it?"
of forms?
yeah
madlocke was supposed to have done some work on that but we have seen no code for it
ahh
that kind of "under development"
"as opposed to ""it works, just don't sneeze the wrong way"""
I dunno those forms weenies might know more than I about it :P
chillywilly: how to apt-get source package? different name or command?
'apt-get source package'
anyway
brb
thanks
"Isomer: yeah, that kind of ""under development"" :)"
anyone here?
masta back?
jc?
what's wrong with libGDA?
seems that it really does not have too many dependencies
"orbit, gconf, oaf, and glib"
was that the only objection?
the dependencies?
for what? geas?
anyone here use xchat?
yes
why don;t we use libgda for all data access?
that's its point isn't it?
I don't think it was ready when we were ready
oh
"plus it's fairly unix-specific, IIRC"
BUT
looks good now though
shouldn't be
I do think we should write a pseudo-dbdriver for it
it ha s awrpaper over the CORBA
you could actually do a different ORB for libGDA
has a C API
I dunno
I just remember eveyone hated it
cause it used to depende on X
chillywilly: is there a way to make xchat automatically connect to a server and log into my favorite channels?
maybe it is ported to Gnome 2.0 architectre
and use GObkect now
GObject
jcater: yes
chillywilly: the whole libGDA thing was before I came on
ummm
so I really don't know much about it
http://www.gnome-db.org
is does xml sql queries
ansd to do another data source you implement a CORBA server
that implekents the GDA IDL
or somethin'
neilt: hey
hey
what was the reason for not using libGDA?
X dependencies?
bonobo dependencies?
chillywilly: how do I do that w/xchat?
right?
jcater: hold up
you got to the server list

#python is a useless channel
why?
no one home?
"well, for the last half hour, they've been discussing bacon and pizzas"
haha
does guido ever hang out there?
I didn't even know there was a #python
not that I've seen
I went there yesterday to ask a question
first time I've had to ask a python question :(
they were kinda condescending
hmmmm
YGD?
YGD?
young genious's disease
I suppose
bah
there's a guy called dash in there
#debian is also about as useful
always yacking
he thought our project had been dead for a while
and let me know he thought so :)
what did he do?
"well, he told me how useless our web site was"
he asked if there was any code
heh
"(<jcater> well, I use it in a 40 node call center)"
"(<dash> oh, well what is it)"
and so on
k
GNUe is the shit man
:P
"chillywilly: dont know about libGDA, need to ask reinhard"
haha
that one guys name is booyeah
neilt: okie dokie
http://www.gnome-db.org/docs/manual/libgda/introduction.html
the intro sounds good though
but if it depends on bonobo and X that would suck
the reason iirc was that libgda is more than libgda
but it is also unix-xentric
centric even
libgda has a certain architecture to it.....I don't think you have to use their stupid reports though
or the part we needed would cary a lot of extra stuff
I dunno I got some other ideas
like a GObject ODMG implementation
if that makes sense
we cna call it GDO
libgdo
GNU Data Objects
hehe
whatever
mmmm crack pipe
should be DOG
haha
that way we can have a picture
Distributed Object Glue
to go with our goats
thats it
that's my middleware abstraction idea
or GROAN
we are by the GNUe KC guy ;)
lol
he'll have a lot to read this week :)
mdean: so you say that SOAP and XML-RPC are slow?
hmmm
why didn't KDE use CORBA in its desktop?
ppl always bitch and moan abut CORBA being slow
ah well
I know GEAS is no show stopper in its performance
hmmmm - passing XML documents for a protocol vs. a native version?  I'd say it's slow
I don't think that has to dow with ORBit though
corba is probably quite a bit faster than XML based protocols
they say that SOAP and IIOP are realy the things that do the same things
and you can make you ORB do xml messaging
mdean: that'd be my guess too
"the way I look at it is that you want a native protocol for speed, but optionally support SOAP/XML-RPC/XML-whatever for interoperability"
hmmmm
I don't think ORBit uses xml-rcp/soap at all
nor does that Omni ORB either
doesn't need to - you have a service taking XML-RPC or SOAP requests that can then pass it off to an ORB
hrrrrrm
"do the processing in CORBA objects, return a XML-RPC/SOAP response back to the calling client"
ya I guess so
we still use CORBA then
muuwhahhahaa
we can never get rid of it
we have been assimilated
ja - but expose an XML-RPC or SOAP interface to the application
hehe
"We are GNUe of CORBA!"
jcater: you ever use xml-rpc or soap?
or even look at it?
"I use soap once a week, whether I need to or not"
jcater: :D
xml-rpc is SO easy to implement in python
but I don't use it seriously anywhere
I've just played w/it
well I have looked at xml-rpc a long time ago
when I used to run kde
I wrote bash script
that used xml-rpc call to activate a desktop component
very simple
I wrote a SOAP service and client @ work - service is PERL running SOAP::Lite - client is MS-SOAP called from a JavaScript object in ASP
"libGDA does: mysql, postgresql, sybase, ldap, oracle, interbase, mdb"
manages FTP directories on the Linux box (including LDAP authentication)
"chillywilly: gnue-common does Oracle, Mysql, Postgresql, ODBC, Sybase, SAP-DB, Ingres, Interbase, SQLRelay, informix, and DB2"
ack but the versionb I got installed depends on a lot more crap then what they claim
soon it will do GEAS and raw XML files
:)
libGDA still seems sucky
25 dependencies according to apt
ack!
and they say it only depends on 4
liars!
chillywilly: the "l" part of libGDA only depends on 4
you didn't read ahead to see what the i b G D and A needed
jcater: how can you call python code from C?
chillywilly: I dunno.. never had the desire to
"I don't think it's hard, though"
isn't that a problem then?
what?
cause we should use same db drivers
why is me not having a desire to a problem?
GEAS supports 2 dbs
chillywilly: there's a reason I'm doing the python tools instead of the GEAS c code... I don't have enough crack to code C anymore
it's been too long since I've looked at C
glib makes it all worth while
makes life easier
don't you hate it when ppl send html mail?
I Love HTML email - especially from M$
ello derek
rofl
ok i would LOVE to tell you the libGDA 'uncandidly' but we are a bit too public now
to discuss such things
jcater: how is outlook for looking at the master/detail deficency?
working on it
wassup all?
ajmitch: howdy
hey ajmitchie

"(Nov 6, 2001, 15:03 UTC) (1358 reads) (0 talkbacks) (Posted by mhall) "
1358 ppl have read it :)
nobody has complained in the talkbacks ;)
hehe
wow
that's a lot of ppl
pretty standard for linuxtoday
does www.gnuenterprise.org have webalizer or something so you can watch the traffic?
yes
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/stats/
derek: doesn't show hits over time
huh?
hits over time?
its webalizer
"eg, how many hits per day"
"hmm, ok"
yes it does
"sorry, thought you meant php nuke stats ;)"
click the month you wish to view
crap it shows you hits by hour :)
yeah
i was looking at stats.php
"as i thought, there's a bit of a traffic spike today :)"
you should see the spikes on release days
we avg about 5000 hits a day
well 3500 - 5000
on a release day it often is like 15000 - 20000
and then following day 10000 - 15000
and following day 8000 - 10000
ok
thus why i like releases :)
that's pretty good
peaking at 15000 today
ajmitch: yes very good :)
especially if we have a KC every week :)
"yeah, will raise the profile a bit"
"but since this is the first one, probably will be less visits in following weeks"
btw: for those that care we broke the 1 million hit mark last month (not bad for only like 5 months)
excellent
has on course for over 2 million hits a year (not that hits mean squat) but at least some one is 'looking'
only way i can do that is if i count my local ht://dig hits ;)
"Who told you, that you could stop coding?"
jcater we dont discuss java here!
java?
who mentioned java?
sorry testing old xchat macros
that's a very interesting macro
what's it's point?
"err, its"
% we dont discuss java here.
derek we dont discuss java here.
there we go
making buttons now
jcater: saves typing time :)
ah
so I could do something like: 
"""yeah, ok chillywilly. sure"""
yip
and just assign that to a button?
though i would do
"""yeah, ok %s. sure"""
then you could jsut highlight user you want to substitue with %s and click the button
im adding one now
"""%s: yes, we are working on that"""
I need to do that before we do a release
"or ""%s: no, master/detail is still buggy on contact management screens"""
ah now i have crappie slappie button :)
roflmao
see its little things like this that prevent me from wiping this system :)
I'm gonna test debian + plex86
i need this box to be debian desperately but need to fix other box to 'transfer' full sytem over to it :)
then i can readily get config files and such back if need be
I need sleep
later all
so quiet...
hello jwserra
goodbye jwserra
hmm
hah
probably got scared of all the conversation ;)
any postgresql freaks out here know how to return the current system date/time???
usually done within the programming language AFAIK
date()
er sorry
TIMESTAMP
i think is the function
hmm
" $result = pg_exec (""INSERT INTO client (email, password, created_on)  values ('$email','$hashpwd',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)"");"
for example
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
will give you what you need i think
yes
thanks
sweet.. someone wants me to call about an SA job
actually I dunno which job this ones about
kewl
jobs are always usefu
"chillywilly: IIRC, student loans are exempt from bankruptcy claims"
I know
but those aren't the ones I wanna get rid of
:D
oh
ok
I am not going to do that though
heh
money doesnt grow on trees?
hmm
what's a short word
for "unsupported"
or "nonstandard"
how much debt you got masta?
a lot
he owes me a lot for this damn form
rofl
house and two cars is all debt i currently carry
"this one guy finally created Virtual Private Servers for Linux.. no one has bothered porting the freebsd jail function yet, probably because its being redone in v5.x"
"actually verio and maybe a few might have done it, but no source code released"
not the same as user-mode linux kernel
"he (and I) were surprised someone hadn't ported this to linux yet because it is pretty revolutionary.. he gave one example where they had this old Pentium Classic RH 5.2 box that barely anyone used but they didn't want to get rid of it, so they just moved the file system over and started the services within the VPS and got rid of the machine"
the benefit is that all VPSs can share all resources of the entire machine instead of dedicating RAM and sometimes CPU to a single "VPS"
s/a single/each/
derek: you have no credit cards?
I hate credit cards
I cut all of mine up
http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/miscprj/s_context.hc
"chilly: you need atleast one, and its good to have two just in case one doesn't work ;-)"
no way dude
I have like no credit left on any of them
chillywilly: i have them
well maybe one
oh
and i use them but i pay them off every month
but I will not use any of them anymore
I'm almost out of debt
they are just debts
i have one that my broadband gets charged to automatically monthly
ok
and the then i have one i make all online purchases w/ as i wont use my debit card on the net
but i pay it off at end of every month
when i was younger and more poor
i ran up about 10k in credit card debit (about 6k of that was for supplies to remodel house)
I still have that beat :(
"43,000 in school loans"
"my roommate said he was thinking about buying this house, man I wish he would look around first ugggh.. I'd love to move somewhere else"
the rest are  credit cards and misc. loans
you'll beat it chilly don't worry
"nah, I am workin this job making peanuts"
not forever
I hope not
it is just damn depressing
being this much into debt and nothing to show for it
accept some damn peiece of paper
they makes nice toilet paper
chillywilly: hi.
doesn't sound like a very sturdy degree document.
hmm this company doesn't have any jobs on their site that fit me..
dtm: I dun figured out just how much in debt I am and I feel like crying :P
but when i sold our first house we had about 30k in equity built in it
chillywilly: good ol' cheeley
i had borrowed 15k from my parents so paid them back
derek: heh
heh
sorry had about 40k in equity
derek: equity is good
paid them back 15
my mom would never even have 15k lying around
then paid the credit cards off
and had a nice chunk of change to put down on the new house
and swore to never rack credit card debit again
"if i bought a house these days here in silicon valley (yes it's entirely possible with a sufficient down payment and lease-to-own), in a few years (5-10) it'd be worth way more"
the only two jobs I'll take are: Sun/Linux/FreeBSD/HP Admin or Cisco Network Engineer
or CGI development
my neighbor's house is 20x its original value from the 70's
or 80's
if I can get out of this hole I am gonna scale down to one credut card with a $200 limit :P
lucky
chillywilly: ;)
in this house in past 3 years probably have built about 10k maybe 15k
derek: gerat
great
which isnt bad on a 3 year investment of 25k (my down payment here)
yep
"wow, it'd be neat to have 25k ;)"
i'd settle for being able to pay last month's bills
i had it in an accoutn (normal bank) for a bit
masta how old are you?
27?
while waiting to close
and i liked seeing the interest checks
chillywilly: 27
derek: did you earn all that yourself with no family help or what
dont let it fool you though
my bud talked a house from 133k to 119k last month
Mr_You: heh
"i have been smart with money, but i dont have any real savings"
derek: bummer
derek: why no savings?
other than my state retirement (which isnt bad)
dtm: i dont carry debt
derek: do you work for the state?
but i have bills that press my income to point where i havent been 'saving' money
"my next debt will be my biz, by that time it should be my only real big debt"
that is my new years resolution
derek: yeah that was a silly question for meto ask :)
Mr_You: what sorta biz?
i've been building a bidness lately
i researched small business resources at the county library tonight
to start my deferred compensation of at least 3% of my salary
why you all up in my bidness?
btw: i work for county
sheeeeet
derek: i see
but we are on same retirement system as the state
neat
"the universities, schools, state, city, county all have same retirement system"
"dtm: IT, hosting, GNUe, blah blah blah ;-) "
and it is transferrable to any government
derek: so they have mad stock eh?
;)
Mr_You: HA!  is that your plan?  ;>
i.e. if i went to work for the state or even another state it would transfer
well honestly i was sitting on some cash (about 5k) but am needing to buy a car and went on big fat vacation
gov't jobs are very cushy
but i was thinking stocks are so low right now it wouldnt hurt to dump 5k into market on blue chippers
I need to get me a gov't job
;P
and sit back and see them return to value in 2 - 3 years 
derek: sounds good
chillywilly: hahah
chillywilly: gitcha some cheeez?
plz
chillywilly: working for govt is very irrating most of the time
fromma gubmint
this is the dairy state dude
and it pays ok to good
derek: hehe
"if for right person, but can pay like crap too"
derek: what's your summary explanation for its irritation?
um i have too favorite phrases:
"Mr_You: any further plans, docs, etc?"
definition of insanity: doing the same thing you have always done and expecting different results
don let the doro hit ya where the good lord splitcha?
s/doro/door
s/don/don't
"maricopa county, we put the FUN in dysFUNctional"
derek: heh
"seriously, there is a lot of 'we always did it this way' mentality"
hehehe
and of course everything that is good has to be expensive
i.e. they waste money like mad its just sick
derek: yep
i laughed when pentagon spent like what 500 bucks for a toilet seat
no GNUe solution for maricopa county yet?
;P
and thought man someone has to be giving a kick back or somethhing
but i will tell you for all their bureaucracy stupid stuff like that really happens
and its not necessarily 'govt officials' out to get public gain
its just really stupid decisions and vendors taking advantage of it
heheh
I could've worked for the city
chillywilly: TRUE STORY
we were on a conference call with a vendor
I satyed at L. S. Research and then they let me go
who i will remain nameless
stupid thing to do
oh well
we were doing contract negotiation
"our lawyers, director of technology, county administrator (CEO basically) with their lawyers and top of the line on conference call"
there was an argument about things and who would do what
we didnt want to pay their consultants
we wanted to do some stuff in house and just pay for training
they THOUGHT they hit mute
and said something like
"""let them do it, you know how government employees are, we can let them pay for training and when they are too clueless to figure it out, we will just charge them the full price for consulting and tell them told you to do up front in contract"""
that was 'you know how STUPID govt employees are
our IT director went off
and it was embarassing for the vendor
haha
but you know what is jacked
we still signed a contract with them
we paid for the training
the consulting
that is stupid
and then additional consulting and a higher rate later when they broke contract
its like the govt has no BALLS
I would have nir eballs
imho
"btw: erase everythign i said, its a lie"
knowing tha this is the ppl's money
it is not their money
eveyone fucking apid all those damn taxes
paid
oops
well you know what it was
the board approved the stuff
and to drop this vendor and 'redo the RFP' etc
would have take 8 more months
and they needed a solution ASAP
that's all you gotta do dude
which is why they stuck with vendor
geta  contract with a gov't office
you are set
:D
then when the contract fouled up
youc na retire
they didnt 'argue' cause they didnt want to have a 'bad' relationshiop
as we are 'locked' to that vendor
they wanted me to hack on the city tie program
time
and if we piss them off then no support and we have to go find a new product and 2 years go down the drain
pretty said eh
the program that keeps track of the time all the city of Milwaukee workers use
"and when people say GPL is dumb, this is why i want to smack them :)"
"er, work"
which is one rason why you like how GNUe is working?
s/rason/reason/
yes
if you dont like your gnue consultant fire their ass
hire a internal programmer
they were a contractor with the city
or find another cnosultant
it won't tak emuch to get into the code
aaaah
the power of Free Software baby
getting more bang for your buck
and more freedom
who would've guessed?
;P
woohoo
I almost have masta's form fully functional!!!
I don;t even feeling like fixing this
both threads are suspended waiting on each other to remuse them
hehe
scooby doo is on
I need ot hack up some thread safe streams for GNU Common C++
s/ot/to
derek: why?
"derek: If I get this working, you owe me a good hot cocoa next time we meet :)"
heheh
lol
hot cocoa?
"btw, I like my hot cocoa with an irish touch :)"
i'll have krispy kremes waiting at the booth in NY for you
are you mena or mice?
er men
derek: NY?
is that when the next GNUe meeting is gonna be?
chillywilly: that is LWCE NY in January
muuwhahahahahaa
mmm

hmm
what will you do then eh?
a fresh batch comes off in 1/2 hour
"hey, I'm in NY"
hmm
nickr!!!
that's damn scary isn't it
you have a spare bedroom?
nickr: want to house jason for a few days?
hey nickr
or help work the gnue booth
I think he can barely house humself right now dudes
"I'd say its possible, I don't know what my situation will be exactly come january, but I'll see"
"I am squating in an unfinished apartment, but there is room if needbe"
I'd definitely like to help work the gnue booth
"any fsf hacking buddies with a room, a couch, a floor would do as well "
the gnue budget doesnt exactly include heavy travel expense allocations :)
lol
we can lay down plastic and bedding on the floor
hmmm
better than my "doghouse" :)
well techincally jason is AI and doesnt require sleep at least not in a 3 / 4 day stretch like this
"oops, better not let wife see that remark"
"so as long as you have an outlet, caffiene and climate control you're good"
are donuts at 1:30 a bad idea?
nah
jcater: sound good to me :)
theres a dunkindonuts/togos/baskinrobins down the street
is there ever really a bad time for donuts?
cool
nourishments :)
jcater: there is pizza down the street too
what was the one i really like
pizza joint?
and pizza joint too?
up in upper west side
I WNAT PIZAA
im a lard ass in phoenix where i have to drive 5 minutes to get anything
if i lived in walking distance of say a pizza joint like in new york
derek: you lard ass
aahhhhh  thanks dan
i would be 400lbs EASY
there are five pizza places within walking distance here
hmmmm
derek: 400lbs is a lot.
cool
fyi
pizza hut is a ways away form me
like if you set down a large pizza i will eat like 3 pieces until im full
oh wait
"derek: if you are ever in memphis, I'll take you out"
denellis is close though
then if someone leaves pieces in the box
er
"i say, anyone gonna eat that"
danellis
"we have a wonderful, expensive place called ""Little Caesars"""
:)
if no yes i eat every piece in the box even if i feel like im gonna vomit
i REALLY cant help it
derek: uhhhhh
derek: yeah that's an addiction
derek: would you hurt someone for pizza/
jcater: oddly my pizza disease isnt choosy im like an alcholic
derek: rofl
that is bad
even little caesars will be consumed by me :)
hehe
I was serious
I am cheap
um
i dont know if i have EVER had pizza i wouldnt eat
I like little ceasars
but I'd be glad to have you visit memphis :)
(not counting pizza w/ topings i dont like)
we could visit graceland
I like smaller piza places
actually maybe we could meet in branson sometime :)
they have netter pizza than the nig boys
better even
lol.. that's not a far drive
"course, wife wants to go"
she might be upset if I met someone else besides her there
"y'all just keep yer mouths quiet, i KNOW im a hick so shut yir pie holes :)"
jcater: really?
jcater: sadly our family is from round dem dar parts so meet there fairly regularly
jcater: that sounds like me
derek: really?
that's not too terribly far from here
I bet jamest could drive that distance too :)
the 'neighbors' are from the southeast corner of missouri right on the arkansas border
derek: I'm sorry
then they migrated to kansas city
"hehe, so I guess you visit the Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World frequently??"
grandparents ended up in between at lake of the ozarks
BEAUTIFUL spot right on the lake got it in the 50's and other grandparents ran a resort there in the 50's
so i grew up with summers on the lake
"thus my crappie jokes the other day, i was serious :)"
lol
one cousin is down in northern arkansas now
I can fillet those puppies with nar a bone anywhere
he had a bright idea that the emu/ostrich farming was going be a boon
he got a buttload of them
rofl
I have uncles like that
in arkansas no doubt
I want emus
and made good money for a bit selling the eggs and the meat (its actually rather good meat)
they are funny
but he got out of the 'trade'
the emus are mean mofo's
any of you ever go ice fishing?
tore the crap out of things and he would get fairly injured dealing with them
he has like two left that he sells the eggs from
;)
chillywilly: I have frozen fishticks in my freezer... that's as close to ice fishin as I've done
but he had had like 50 of them
"chillywilly: ice fishing is like hunting in the snow, you have to like cold balls to do it"
I want a ratite preserve
rofl
I guess I'd need tolive in a warm climate for that though
you ppl are wimps anyway
"chillywilly: yeah, so?"
you couldn't handle the cold
beer helps you know :P
and last i looked they didnt sell gloves for my nuts :)
you didn't go tto the right store
we have electric nut warmers up here
:D
"oddly you are probably right, sure in WI you could get such things :)"
WI's are practically canadian
just have your old lady hold them for you
nickr: nah
chillywilly: take off you hoser
heheh
jcater: actually the neighbors are from 'mountain grove' area if i remember correctly
so...

another non-standard in Postgresql
where id = null 
:(
derek: we have liftoff!!
liftoff?
our first application form :)
one he was working on
"heh, k"
"that's a good thing, right? ;)"
"oh, yeah"
night
poor jcater i think he thinks he fixed things :)
:)
"he'll learn, much like i did, that your abilities to break things far exceed our abilities to fix them"
i often wonder
"After two years of hard work and more than 700 thousand lines of code written, the sleepless hackers at Ximian are finally getting to the long-awaited 1.0 release of Evolution, the GNOME groupware suite."""
is the 700 thousand lines of code 'worth bragging about'?
?
what are you talking about?
see above sentence
"whoops, didn't see it"
after two years of hardwork and more than 700 lines of code....
er 700 thousands
it's C
i saw that and was like thats nearly a MILLION lines of code
when i look at evolution it doesnt look THAT complex
that pygmy email program (much simpler indeed) was like 3 py fles
files
none probably over 50 lines of code :)
"i lied pygmy has 9,010 lines total in all its .py files"
but C gives l33t performance dood!
joo know joo n33d l33t perf0rm4nce when r34ding mail from your Gs
speed readers might end up waiting on the machine to scroll or something
i just looked at gnue its interesting
GNUe Forms src: 5986  GFObjects: 1411 Total:7397
a huge chunk of forms has been moved into gnue-common
so you have to count that as well
GNUe Common src: 3261 masks: 2135 drivers/comm: didnt count Total: 5396
GNUe Reports src: 1978
GNUe Designer src: 4361
you should filter out comments :)
"so about 12,000 lines of code"
"for reports, forms and designer :)"
including comments
"guess this is why i kind of gasp at comment of 700,000 lines of code "
:)
however
look at geas :)

i have no idea what she looks like

i think we can get the gnuef code cleaner in the long run too
datastore: 906
methods: 1054
objectcache: 1687
but to be fair you should count the db driver code in gnue-common
there is a chunk of code in there
object...: 3656
oql: 1942
yeahaw!
aol.com decided i exist again!
total:49248
"jamest: agree on dbdrivers, i just wanted to get ball park numbers"
and i dont know how to make wc go recursive
so doing each dir of db drivers would be painful :)
"but at 12,000 add a liberal say 10,000 for db code (to be obnoxious) and 22,000 lines is still miniscule (IMO)"
db driver are 4309 lines of code
for all of them
well i stuck to engineer fashion and doubled it for estimate :)
not bad right :)
i have to run :(
see ya all in a bit
reinhard: number of lines
crap
silly xchat
 re: number of lines
you should be careful not to count generated code files
"we have a lot of them in geas, thus the 50.000 lines"
"26924 are orbit-generated, that's more than 50%"
"probably evolution ppl counted generated code, too"
to have a high number of lines to show off :)
:)
kinda like some packages and their dependencies :)
plus number of lines depends on coding style
like old geas parser code has 4317 lines
new geas parser code (nearly finished) w/ basically identical function has 2088 lines
and i guess the percentage of comments is higher for the new code :)
comments? IN the code? ABOUT the code?
odd
howdy
i think derek has more bug for you :)
<derek> poor jcater i think he thinks he fixed things :)
crap
"well, it worked for me"
:)
I was rather proud
there were several bugs squashed last night
:)
"(proud that I squashed them, not that there were several bugs)"
you the man
so you gnue'ing today?
if I can keep users at bay
"(so far, no good)"
hmm
does it work for you?
i'll pick mine up at same time
i figure i don't want to have people mauled (via a dog)
hmm
I think I'll bleach mine blond
but ankle bites might be annoying enough to have them avoid my office
and put a spike collar on him
"I'd make it redish, give him a little compaq t-shirt and a red cap"
the last time I saw that combination I was terrified
roflmao
me too
jcater i see your newest commits
yeah
i tested last night at like 2am my time and things were still broken
will try cvs again tonight to see if fixed now
la la la
hear even
you can do a quick test to the most noticeable issue now
what was it doing?
if you have say like 3 records
go to any record other than the first record
then go to address
add a new address
then press the save button
(it saves the data and for the right contact)
"HOWEVER, it moves the recordset back to teh first record"
sigh
this was before your last commits from this AM
"so it might be fixed now, though it didnt appear the commits where addressing this particular issue (but who i am i to say)"
no
it was actually by design
(for the time being)
but I will look at it
were there any other issues?
other than navigational?
um dont know
just tested data with right record
AND
going back to first record
"1st one seems fixed, second one still broke, but you note thats by design :)"
but want to verfiy with latest cvs commits form this AM
before i give it the stamp of approval
i.e. give me more time to make your life hell
lemme makes sure I have this right
"in all cases, it is committing the correct changes to the database"
but it's just not behaving like you'd expect after the commit?
or is it not committing correctly either?
(cause those are two different places to look -- one's a gnue-common problem and the others a gnuef problem)
"btw, that ""by design"" didn't necessarily mean that's the way we wanted... just that there were issues we couldn't resolve at the time so that was the ""safe"" thing to do"
"(if you deleted a record before the current record (or if you deleted the current record), the logic wasn't there to recalculate the new current record)"
"'course, that was a brain fart on my part"
it seems blatantly obvious now
rofl
i THINK the problem is just 'not behaving how i would ike after the commit'
"i.e. my few tests in the wee hours appeared to save data properly, but i would like to give mroe testing before i 100% say that :)"
lol
so dig in the other area and see what you can do and this evening i will retest and we will go from there
almost finished
with luck we can release by monday
plus if i can get mdean to repair the dclgw tree
and get all new commits in there or even in dcl head
i might whip some other forms together
which will be good test on designer
as well as forms
sigh
masta creating forms
that scares me
you
mdean is the one that should be scared
btw: on reports i was going to compile a comprehensive list of report objects
which woudl translate to tags/attributes
from another reporting tool (prop)
mdean had a lot of input on that
to use as a base point for discussion about gnue standards
he's used quite a few
and his thinking was in line w/mine
(not sure what yours is :)
if you think that is of interest
but you might want to solicit his input as well
probably different :)
this wasnt meant as a proposal
merely a 'reference' point to start a discussion
"well, we need to get the ball rolling"
i mean off top of head i can think of thigns like
probably 
"so, please be my guest"
report tag
header/footer 
grouping
sub grouping
title
etc etc
"but bound to 'miss' some 'ideals', so was thinking at lookign at another tool to compile whats there to help job our memories of what might be valuable in reporting"
i think we should KISS
I agree
but a fully functional KISS
and slowly add things in
(don't need a sloppy KISS)
so say up front most of the 'tags' will be there
but the 'fine tuning' attributes of that tags will slowly creep in
as when i look at the prop system its all objects and properties
the objects would be similar to tags and the properties similar to attributes
I'll have to see an example to understand where you're going :)
and it looks like we would probably need most of the tags to do anything useful but many of the properties/attributes while useful could be ignored for some time and still have a functional reports
well first i should ask what you and mdean were thinking
make sure im not wasting my time as you might be doing a totally different approach
"well, sections with section headers, footers "
"course, sections can contain sections"
(these may be what you are calling groups)
ok we are on same page
well technically this prop tool calls things
BANDS
ack
and that is pretty common lingo in reporting
bands can contain sections
and sections can contain sections etc
when i say grouping
i mean something that tells the report to 'groupby'
i.e. a section starts over at some grouping point (me is saying this poorly)
i imagine it will be an 'attribute' of section
hello all
is jamest around
howdy
"yes, but don't tell anyone"
jcater: in their deal you have a 'band' which can have types like
groupheader
groupfooter
title
pageheader
pagefooter
detail
child
summary
etc etc etc
yeah
that's along the same lines as I was thinking
"(and mdean aswell, IIRC)"
we just used different terminology
bbs
cool so it might be worth me fleshing out (mapping) this stuff
as a starting point
we can change terminology and cut and add as we like but should help us have meaningful discussion :)
"hi ToyMan, you about ready to go :)"
hi all
hi sevik
dneighbo: super code weekend for whom??
:)
you of course
ready for a reports pasting?
um
sure
actually
sevik: you here?
http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt
please comment
"can get mdeans response tonight, but would like to forge some standards soon"
so i can look at starting the xslt conversions
what is this based on?
(just curious)
jamest: you here?
"oh, wait.. it's your lunch hour"
jcater: i could say but i would have to kill you
it is based on the report package included in delphi (quick reports) i think
it is similar to crystal and other ones i have used
I should've known
:)
"btw: before the flames start we used quickreports one time, but the desinger was so horrible we went to a third party instead"
but i think the 'basic elements' are fairly universal among all report tools
and since i happened to have this on a machine at work i went from there
i strongly suggest if others have crystal reports etc
that they compare to this list and see whats missing whats stupid etc
so we have even a better spot to jump from
i.e. im not suggesting we implement this (its not a proposal) its 'reference material'
jcater you are eeriely quiet
dneighbo: we're busy ordering our "Delphi Blows" t-shirts
"not that it does or anything, we just can't like what you do"
:P
dneighbo: there's called users
jcater: btw - I'm back 
whatcha need
I forgot
"oh, yeah"
I think we should add a port= attribute to the connections file (and <database> tag)
optional of course
dneighbo: you have any sample reports done like this?
yes but in delphi :)
well i would have to dig to find them as they are old
the part im torn on is we have two phases
pre data population
post data population
some of these are needed pre and some post and some both
hmm
not sure what you mean
im still kind of struggling how the source template will look
"also, I wander about the expressions"
and what the output will look like
would these not be the same as triggers/events?
well expressions are 'triggers' really
:)
ok
remember this is reference material 
ie terminology etc will be different
I know... just making sure I understand
systemdata will be like triggers too
only it would be nice to have set reportFunctions
like
date
page x of x
etc
in systemdata
I agree
although I wander about that page x of x
so people dont have to write code really just pick the systemdata type
jcater : printing is a WHOLE other animal
as that's putting output specific stuff in the report
xml generation
exactly :)
im really torn on all this
I have ideas too
on the page numbers and page orientation etc etc etc
and I think they fall in line (basically) with what you have
i dont think it belongs in the xml files
I agree
well let me rephrase that
i think some things like orientation etc MIGHT belong there
for 'default' purposes
"('course, I'd like to have something (anything) usable)"
"but thats why i say printing, page, printer stuff is still 'fuzzy' to me"
but i think its somewhat secondary at this point
as more than likely html will be the first output type
and those things arent as relevant :)
"but soon they will be, im hoping you and mdean have the ideas for that stuff :)"
just seems everyone has been participating a lot past few weeks and i wanted to capitalize on the renewed enthusiam and try to get an spec to somewhat emerge as i think it is one of the things holding reports from being usefull on a larger scale
yes
and KC seems to be bringing in new ppl
cool
(at least there's been several responses on mailing lists)
if we release again soon and another kernel cousin it could get scary in here :)
"although, it's frustrating that people seem to forget this is an all-volunteer effort :("
"but, so goes the beast"
yip
"its burger king alright, ie you can have it your way"
"just unlike BK if you want it your way, you better be willing to cook it yourself :)"
roflmao
we have steak houses like that here
"you get it your way, but there's an open grill :)"
funny we have them here too
I never understood that
one of the reported 'best burger' spots in phoenix is you walk in and pay 5 bucks for a patty and bun
and go out to the pit and cook er up
"If I go out to a restaurant, I want it cooked for me"
"otherwise, why would I go out?"
me too
note thats why i said 'reported'
"if i pay for food, someone else better be making it and serving it :)"
as i can get a pound of ground beef for 1.49 and 8 buns for .49
so for 2.00 i can get 4 quarter pounders and have two buns left over :)
why would i pay 5.00 to cook my own at a restaurant :)
"well, I never realized the extremely cheap part, but that's good to know"
rofl
lol
:)
jamest: you see my port= statement?
yip
we need port?
i kinda figured that individual db driver could have different attributes anyway
so port= on the ones that need it is fine with me
ok
i was just gonna say make it optional
and if its blank use default
yip
so say for postgres or mysql
someone wouldnt have to put port=
only if they were on non standard port
what made this come up btw?
curiosity
meow
bang
"cats dead move along, nothign to see here"
:D
or
}O}
dneighbo: I think you are hooked up with your form
I fixed the navigation issue
"now, dammit, your form works"
do we understand each other???
:)
yeah!
what he said!
hi
man this morning the leaf vacuums were here.. god they are so loud
woohoo
we have roughly 26000 lines of python
heh
not that that's any measure of anything
it measures someone has been doing something ;-)
good point
"jcater: this morning i was only measuring 17,000"
"wonder where the other 9,000 came from"
how do you measure?
"that was going on 12,000 on everything outside of gcomm and dbdriver"
jamest said dbdriver had 5k
wc -l *.py
is how i counted
oh
well I like my count better :)
"well you are far from topping 700,000 that evolution is bragging about"
or the 50k that geas holds
"i didnt test your patches, but the form works ;)"
"yeah, but look what those 17,000 (or 26,000) do"
:)
"whether it works or not it, it works ok"
yes i look at evolution which is a nice piece of software with lots of features
and think how the hell can that be 700k lines of code?
maybe they include ever single library included?
way i look at it when i count lines of code i dont count modules etc
for example i dont count lines of wxpython or pygresql code etc
miguel says its so many lines because the 'specs are so complicated for mail and such'
and i have to think damn they had full calendar code already in gnome calendar
so all that code shoudl be resuable
etc etc
as components
and there has to be half a billion mail libraries out there
so either ximian is writing all libraries from scratch (probably)
or they have some really really really think gui code
er s/thick/think
"well, crap"
can I go postal
after fighting py2exe for um "some time"
i find out it doesn't support pyXML
so I switch to McMillan installer
searching to find help with an issue there I find a post saying that mxDateTime had a license change and is no longer freely redistributable
which kinda puts a nail in the coffin of a setup.exe install
for windows machines
hmm
we can grab the DateTime from Zope
they grabbed an old version of mxDateTime
while it was still GPL'ed
(just an idea)
and how do we do that w/ the newer db drivers?
night all
jamest: I don't think the basic functionality of DateTime has changed over time
it's worth looking in to
it may well be
sometime next few days can we try to contact madlocke for a one last time and ask him to email his code?
hello all
howdy
Mr_You: yes
l8r
i brought up this before teh mx stuff
i thought said it was no effect to us?
do we have a GPL compatiable problem and distribution problem?
well
jamest is talking about prebuilt packages that include mxDateTime
mxDateTime is under the Python 2.0 license
which RMS didn't think was GPL-compat because of the jurisdiction clause
"so, I dunno"
hi all
howdy
hi
ra3vat: let's gp russian private? ;)
ra3vat: let's go russian private? ;)
StormBringer: Are you ready?
ra3vat / StormBringer : two questions / requests
ok
if you guys speak of anything that might be use to others in your russian sessions can you let psu know so he can include in kernel logs or just reiterate the stuff here for him to pickup
and second
any chance one of you would be willing to make russian translations of the kernel cousins for gnue :)
"ok, may be me to save other's skills for coding :)"
rofl
no you have to code too :)
btw: the post to forms list you made was very good
"ok, thanks :)"
hello m
howdy
nickr: you around ?
dneighbo: ok. i think i can make russian translations. where will i get cousins from and where must i put in into?
jcater or jcater_ you here?
here
got time to talk
about triggers
sure
mdean can you paste our conversation from #dcl here on this subject
also mdean can we talk reports later :)
http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt 
hmmm - how do I copy/paste in xchat?
nm - found it :)
********************* Trigger Conversation Flood Coming **********************
[18:36:46] <mdean> I do have a quick conceptual ? for you dneighbo
[18:36:53] <mdean> about form triggers
[18:36:57] <dneighbo> ok
"[18:37:28] <mdean> if GNUe is to be language independent, how will you implement triggers from a Python form in PHP (for example)"
"[18:37:32] <dneighbo> Maniac um if we tell jcater to stop working on gcomm it might be ready next week, he is AI after all"
[18:37:39] <mdean> just a curiosity more than anything
[18:37:45] <dneighbo> evil question
[18:37:47] <Maniac> dneighbo: make it so
[18:38:03] <mdean> dneighbo: I've been kicking around an idea tho
"[18:38:04] <dneighbo> you would be laughing your ass off if you saw jamest, jcater and me in the hotel in SF discussing this topic :)"
[18:38:15] <dneighbo> and the next day at the booth
[18:38:18] <dneighbo> and over breakfast
[18:38:24] <dneighbo> and on the wharf
[18:38:33] <dneighbo> well let me say this
[18:38:55] <dneighbo> the thing we all agreed on was that we want to make a trigger/event system that is shared by the appserver and forms
[18:39:14] <dneighbo> so whether you are in two tier or n tier mode its the same and so once a language is supported in one its in the other
[18:39:26] <dneighbo> the big contention became....
[18:39:37] <mdean> install all supported langs?
[18:39:43] <dneighbo> a. how to support oop things in not very good oop languages
[18:39:54] <dneighbo> b. how to handle namespacing and forms referencing
[18:40:01] <mdean> <cough>xml</cough>
[18:40:29] <dneighbo> there was this toyed thought that at first after fleshing it out started to look like we were creating our own language rather than using the 'native' language
[18:40:37] <mdean> <cough>xml</cough>
[18:40:40] <dneighbo> we did NOT want that
[18:40:47] <dneighbo> well we did discuss xml actually
[18:40:59] <mdean> d00d!  it could work!
[18:41:13] <dneighbo> it just didnt sit right in fleshing it out :)
[18:41:33] <mdean> I think it would be ideal
[18:41:37] <dneighbo> i think jcater and i were leaning towards trying to be as native to teh language as possi
********************* Trigger Conversation Flood Stop **********************
ok
hmmmm
I have a detailed text file in gnue-common/docs
missed some
mdean: do you log anywhere?
my buffer
:)
I have a detailed text file in gnue-common/docs that discusses the pros/cons of different approaches
"it doesn't pick one, by the way"
but it is jamest and my scratchpad
"(well, I guess detailed is relative :)"
http://lxr.gnue.org/gnue/source/gnue-common/doc/TriggerSpecifications.txt
TriggerSpec?
for anyone wanting follow along at home
I do suffer from memory leaks after all
"note that when I use the notation <field>, that means the field object's name"
"i have to run but will be around in an hour, hopefully i miss alot as it means progress :)"
hey ppl
reads even
hi neilt
"hi jcater, mdean"
chillywilly: 'sup?
nothin' much
hello cw
howdy
I must go get the wife - bbiab
for more discussion ;-)
suckage
"dewds, I don't see what the deal is about being language independent"
for triggers/methods
if you look in the logs I discussed a plugin system that we could use
with a cache
an xml cache
like what gstreamer does
to find plugins
huh?
"you just write a plugin for that language and it searches certain paths and interrogates the plugins, etc......if you look even further back reinhard and I talked about this too"
I don't remember when that was
it was a wile ago
while
that's fine
but that's not what we're talking about
then what are you talking about?
I'd envision languages to be plugins kinda like you are describing
we have to have a common way inside those languages to identify our objects
i.e.
GObject bindings ;)
I think we should use the GObject system in glib
say we support gack
it si nice
gack
where is a quick readme on the GObject system
ummm
I still think we are discussing 2 different things
an executive summary or such :)
you can get a good feel just by looking at the API docs
I did anyway
you have a link?
it can load "types" from .so files too
yes
sec
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gobject/index.html
check out GTypeModule
they have a nice run time tye system too
argh!
type
time out error on developer.gnome.org :(
crap!
my roadrunner is crappy last 2 weeks
well that blows chunks
half the time I timeout on google
:(
ah
working now
I think the Gnome system is finally gonna get good an most stupid unnecessary dependencies will go away
you are looking at technical implimentation details... we haven't even reached that level yet
you also get
"however we maintain our object references, we have to answer the question"
"of how will the objects be represented in the language's namespace and how will those references tie back into the forms, geas, or reports instance"
mayeb I am getting ahead
I dunno
I think so
gobjects does look awefully cool though
yea
:)
well why not language bindings for GObject?
you could have a python GObject
if you write some code
:P
I dunno though
i'm sure
you got a point
and I see what you mean
actually
what I sorta envision is a GNUeObject or something derived from GObject that is data-aware
implements ODMG or some OO db abstraction
whoa
is that sane?
slow down
we are discussing language mapping here :)
the "objects" that we are referencing are already implemented
"(i.e., they are forms, form blocks, form fields, report sections, etc)"
the question is how do we reference these objects consistently in the individual languages' namespaces
"err, the question at hand"
well we have some objects too which could be the same object that forms uses just that sometimes those objects are not always in geas but forms has its own layer so it is indepedent
"(there are, of course, plenty of questions to come later on :)"
hmmmm
"are blocks, fields, etc. ui stuff?"
common should be ui abd backend indepent right?
and also communication independent
"i.e., ""common"""
hehe
um
I would say they are not UI stuff
but they are tool specific
well you must also realize I know dick about forms
so plz bare with me
(so you are right they are not part of common)
ok
a different layer in the forms architecture
yes
I do think I see where you are going though
"also, please remember I adhere to the KISS principle as much as possible :)"
we should make an architecture diagram or something :P
oh yes
this is just refactoring how things should be right?
isn't that basically what we are doing now
trying to figure out how it all shoul fit together
um
"for a v1.0 release, python only bindings IMHO is perfectly fine.  Add perl, php, C, C++, scheme, visual basic bindings for v2.0 and rev quickly :)"
Isomer: I agree
me too
visual basic??
ack
isn't there some delusional group trying to reimlpement VB for *nix?
hmmm
I have no idea about that one
yes
GnomeBasic?
I think so
or something
there's gnome-basic and kde-basic IIRC
heheh
yea
see? told you they were delusional :)
I imagine we will do tcl shortly after python (as someone was wanting that and showed me documents on it's libraries :)
seriously jcater though haven't you been refactoring thing from the get go?
we'll probably do scheme shortly thereafter
(for political purposes)
heh
"pulling out styff into common, db drivers, etc."
then we can start porting emacs to it :)
chillywilly: yip
"or porting it to emacs, as the case may be :)"
haha
we need a forms emacs ui driver
;P
"chillywilly: seriously, there's been talk about that"
as odd as it sounds
(it sounds VERY odd to me :)
I know there has
and I was only half kidding
emacs rox
I have a very vague recollection that emacs already has something
argh!
my son has a tape fetish I think
he finds tape anywhere
and he wraps everything up in it
hahah
kids are awesome
I thought we were finally tape-free
and very netertaining
entertaining even
but he stripped down some old boxes and used
rofl
their tape to wrap our VHS cassettes
he's gonna love Xmas :)
yes
and/or the local datawarehous
he found our first aid tape
and taped up barney
he found my masking tape and taped up my computer
heheh
I love it dude ;)
I got a story to tell
we were taking scotty over to his aunt's house when we would go to work
well caroline's aunt
"anyway, he didn;t like it much there"
so then when she came to the house to visit
he locked the door on her
rofl
he didn't want her to come in
"also, when she came in"
she was sitting by caroline's mom
then she got up and went to the bathroom
scotty moved he rmom's chaor
"when she came back he said,  ""you can't sit by my grandma aunty sandy"""
lol
TJ has recently learned how to unlock our interior doors
and I don't mean by the little knobs that you normally use
you know the little slots you can stick a flat screwdriver in to unlock from the other side?
"well, he found a toy that "
fits in that
it's his 'key'
hehe
sigh!
no more locking him in the basement
they aretoo smart dude
rofl
"yeah, I can here it in 10 years"
he was just mena to aunt sandy the whole time she was there
"""dad, you actually used such a low level language as python??"""
"""you mean, it was a typed language?"""
when she went o get a soda out of the fridge he was saying hey you can;t drink my grandma's soda
jcater: :P
jcater: you would think of that
?
I think you are more computer obsessed than me
;)
LOL
they just put food on the table :)
computers rules dude
(not yet but soon they will....muuwahahahahaha)
you will be my digital beotch
that's what my computer wants to tell me
he's just waiting for the right moment
when the computers will take over thw world
;P
nah
I think there are fundamental deficiencies in computers
I've never met a computer that likes chocolate... who could possibly rule the world and not enjoy chocolate????
well we need some better AI
however
jcater is our best AI yet :P
"yeah, but he has a weakness"
donuts!!!
rofl
Mmmm Donuts!
hmmm
they should deliver donuts
like they do pizza
man you are lazier than me too?
how is this possible!
practice
lots o' practice
j/k
I think delivery donuts qwould kick ass
my scotty *loves* donuts
hahah
he's got good taste eh?
did I tell y'all about 2 weekends ago?
nope
I had a box of krispie kremes
and I was saving several for breakfast
I had them put up
but I get up saturday morning
to find barney on the television 
and donut glazing all over my living room
but no donuts anywhere
eeek
3 years old and he'd finished off my box o' donuts
sigh
I miss my donuts
daddy has taught him well
donuts == good
hahah
buy more :P
it's the perfect excuse
get a combination lock for the donut cupboard
Isomer: he's a persistent little guy
I'm sure he'd crack it
so set him interesting challenges to open the door
eg: he's got to code "Hello World"
"once he's cracked that, he *deserves* the donuts"
lol
"and then, you change it to something else, like writing a *good* sql database"
and so on
you'll soon have a productive member of society
who wants that?
I try to be as unproductive as I can
IRC helps a *lot*
jcater: can you and jamest check last two messages i've sent to gnue-forms maillist to discuss later tomorrow? 
sure
gah
gah?
anyone know why I always have to do killall fetchmail
then run fetchmail again and it then will grab my mail
it is fscking retarded
ra3vat: when did you send the messages? today?
yes
"chillywilly: fetchmail sometimes hangs due to timeouts, and occasionally stops polling a site until you restart it (however it usually emails you when it does this)"
huh... I'm not subscribed to GNUe-Forms maillist.  I didn't know that!
I'll grab it from the archives
thats what kc's for :)
howdy
saves me sub'ing to half the internet's mailing lists
Isomer: how goes the install
jamest: howdy
jamest: not so hot at the moment
hmm
I should try again
jamest: hi
hi
Isomer: what's wrong
heheh
you notice all the subscribe messages to gnue-gnu?
er gnue@gnu.org
huh?

ibe    
4 suscribes
probably due to the KC
or me screwing up cleaning out the bounced msg queue yesterday
oh?
jamest: mostly arguing getting python2 installed on this box
Isomer: arguing?
chillywilly: I cleaned the queue yesterday and swore I told it to reject the msgs after I'd manually subscribed them
"well, python2 requires lots of other packages, which require lots of other packages, which..."
and mostly I'm not payed to tinker with installs :)
however I noticed today that the admin reminder was sent to me again
even though the admin says no pending requests
so something screwed up
ok
jcater: :P
masta!
ximian gnome licks my left nut
it sure does
that's more information than I needed to know
maybe that's why so many people like it so much
rofl
rofl
jcater / jamest is there a backlog worth reading?
"well, you need a win98 machine on your right side"
then you'd have it made
derek: yes
i.e. did any trigger or report discussoin happen
derek: somewhat...ad GNUe architecture discussion
i just got here
s/ad/and
too tired to do homework
figured I'd make some bugs
calculus?
yes
ok ready jason
its still broken :)
it saves to proper master from the detail
and it doesnt go back to the BEGINNING of records
but it doesnt go to the right master record either :)
the curse of da masta rears its ugly head
sigh
and it seems to only open one record
I swear it was working at the office
maybe i have something dorked?
it's the curse I tell you :P
jamest: you on gnue-forms maillist? would like to discuss tomorrow about what I posted there
"btw, jcater with GObject we get signals ;)"
ah
l8r
derek: what do you mean it only opens one record?
"i.e., built in event handling"
ra3vat: ok
derek: rofl
it always goes to the last record now :)
like what GtkObject does but without X brain dead dependencies
oops
sigh
"hey, jcater"
"er, nevermind"
jcater: ah
"hey, jamest"
that is why i thought one record
i hit the next record
:)
and nothign
i.e. a blank :)
you wanted something small for release?
bwahahahaah
?
i remembered something
i might try and find time
as I'm still fighting making a setup.exe for windows
??
so what d'ya need?
i started to add a new function to db drivers
so that they returned the total number of records returned by a query
but I don't think i finished
it was in a few of the postgresql drivers
and IIRC was DBI 2.0 compliant
a very minor detail but your mentioning records made me think of it :)
Isomer: you can install python2 along 1.5.2
and I don't think it had too many dependencies required by gnue
not by gnue
mostly python2 deps
no more than say gnucash anyway
:) j/k
I tried getting rh to do a update
but it didn't like me :)
i think I may have applied the proverbial "final straw" on the back of jcater
does our mailing list stuff go into the KC?
too
do we get mailing list stuff
other than spam
i don't seem too
well say I got a bunch of cool ideas
 bc is needed by libgtop-1.0.9-2_helix_1
why?!
and I post to gnue-discuss
will it get in the KC?
the KC suggests it does
it mentions it's a summary of "several mailing lists" and "IRC"
"i.e., are they monitoring out lists?"
"oh, ok"
jcater: you able to look at the fix ?
sorry
was putting son to bed
ok
looking now
I know where it is
you are forgiven now get back to work
I just called the wrong function
maybe I should cut back on that crack
heh
"ok, say we use GObject and we have python bindings to it we should have it so we have a remote version (i.e., GCommon interface (gcd?)) and one where you can download the methods directly and use the GObject directly....thus having a somewhat fat client (sorta like things are now)"
so KC is on LinuxToday site eh
yep
and I get reported as having been mad goat raped
jamest: what function were you talking about??
er?
<sigh>
jcater: give me a bit
i'll find it
 /dcc good_crack jamest
in forms is there a DataObject type abstraction of the various data sources?
"chillywilly: yeah, GObject"
or does it bang right on the DB?
everything is a descendent of GObject
heheh
ah
nit the *real* GObkect though right ;P
not
"chillywilly: no, the *real* gnue-common GObject"
the one from glib 2.0
it's real to US
:)
well yea
but we don;t get a nice run time tyoe system
and the data object does it does have a cache system in it
hmmmm
gnue-common has a typecasting system IIRC
yip
"I need to look at your obejct absatrctions then as we should all use the smae GObject, iirc"
i found it when it bit me in the ass one day :)
lol
s/iirc/imho
dudes
you knwo that GEAS has a DataObject CORBA interface also?
those interfaces shoudl be the same
wouldn't you think?
I mena th emethods of the "DataObject"
hmmmm
looks like I can see how things should fit together after all
wow
unbelievable
"quick, draw a ER diagram"
chillywilly: we wanted to share w/ geas
and move all that into gnue-common
well we definitely should
we should all be using GObject
it's more a time issue at the moment
our Gobject or whatever
GNUeObject
"jamest: yes, it is always the case"
*sigh*
maybe you guys were already aware of this...guess I am just slow and/or haven't thought about it or looked at your code
doh
we want to share everything possible
so
can you stire a GObject to a db?
store
come now share the software
"chillywilly: no , GObjects are lower level than the db"
why?
that is silly isn't it?
GDataObject is IIRC the starting point of our data aware system
hmm
"no, we have a base object that almost everything uses"
you need a UML diagram :)
it provides us std features and lets us easly dump xml defs of objects
jamest: so you are tryint to implement GEAS in forms to some degree also?
are we gonna have both ways to do things?
"um, no"
thin client + GEAS
fat client
?
not implementing geas in gnuef
GObject is internal to our apps
sure you are....GEAS is essentially GObject and GDataObject if you really think about it
same tyoes of things
jcater: GDataObjects.getRecordCount
i am not criticzing whatsoever
sigh
for the record
I thought that was already implemented?
IIRC there was one before based upon the cache contents
just seeing what is common
so if the cache was set to 5 then it'd show up to 5
i added something so that it'd show the true number of records
so GDataObject is backed by the SQL database and inherits from GObject?
i don't recall if I finished it
but it's not work
ing some of the time
:)
it doesn;t
jcater: but forget about it
DAMN!!!
GDataObject is just an SQL abstraction?
argh!!!
I just realized
that's what I'm calling and
maybe it is not as much as GEAS biz objects then
is why masta's form isn't working
jcater: what?
not as high level I mean
IIRC you had a GetRecordCacheCount or something
chillywilly: not as high a level
"jamest, jcater you guys don't just use the object and forget about the DB right?"
ok
not the same htne is it
then
no
if you look in the docs in gnue-common
you'll find a descriptino of all this
commit status?
derek: i vote yes
jamest: would you like a common object system to use that is data aware though or would that kill forms 2-tier?
gah
netsplit
I'm quite happy w/ the data system in gnuef
and I think geas driver will fit in nicely w/ what we have
sigh
jcater: what's up?
I dunno
I think I have to retrace the events in forms
to do what?
 by the time block.processCommit gets called
 the block has navigated to the last record
"ah, of course"
jamest: so you guys are taking GEAS and adapting it 2-tier style?
the Pre-Commit traversals all records
"err, traverses even"
chillywilly: yes/no
the gnue-common driver has schema discovery routines
"so it'll be able to query the geas objects and get methods, structure"
I see
however i'm pretty sure we won't treat them as true object as honestly geas doesn't treat them as objects anyway
unless the API has totally changed
we have a common DataObject interface

ok
found another bug
oh great
man i think this could possibly be the bug report that has surfaced largest number of children bugs :)
derek: you turned my master/detail code on its head
I think master/detail will be the best tested feature of gnuef after this :(
jcater: i feel (indeed have felt) your pain
lol
that form was evil
was??
it uses pre-commit triggers now :)
and derek kept whining about deadlines or something
lol
it's almost like his job depened upon it

man
I bet no one votes for rms

why does red-carpet downloading channel artwork remind me of a o hell?

Gnome was born not out of technical need but a conflict of ideology.
If RMS is chosen it will show that Gnome has continued with it's root cause - creating Free software.
If RMS is not chosen it will show that Gnome has moved on from a base cause of creating free software and is perhaps a bit more open minded about mere open source.
This will be interesting to watch. Imagine the diminished relevance of GNU if he doesn't get it!

is there a recent version on debian?
gnue :P
not in deb format
geas 0.0.6 is in debian sid
but all the dependencies are in woody IIRC
"but no forms, reports, or designer"
soon though
this is what jeff tells us
hmm
debian has a tool to generate packages striaght from cvs doesn't it?
dunno
hmm
thusly unstable always has the most up to date version
or at least one thats no more than 2 weeks old
and forces people into a very short release cycle style of thought
lol
i promise you that would not work w/ us
derek's screamed for over a year for faster releases
"oh, you said short *release* cycle :)"
we just ignore him
or make fun of him
"Isomer: don't worry dude we have a debian maintainer, he''l get his act together soon ;P"
or both
son of a bitch
this package tool has modules named the same as some in wxwindows

chillywilly: I'm not talking crap about python.  I'm just rebelling against learning yet another language. =)  Keeping my skills up in C++ and scheme are hard enough ;)

"'course, I said the same thing last night"
hehe
jbailey: I still like OO in C sometimes
GObject in glib 2.0 looks cool
he's planning to make a form that's even more evil
chillywilly: I've been studying "Refactoring" and "Design Patterns" lately.
?
jbailey: both of which have nothing to do with any specific langauge
"chillywilly: Yeah, but good OO in C looks ugly.  You either have casts all over, or are relying on void pointers all over the place.  "
jbailey: or you use GtkObject/GObject
which has nice macros
and a run time type system
The problem with that is that your optimizer doesn't have a chance to do it's job well there.  The native language features are all designed to be optimized away.
(Or mostly.  There's only so much you can do with RTTI)
some ppl seem to think they can write better code than a compiler

they are mental though

"He's now doing his doctorate in physics, and barely has time to sleep, never mind do any partying. =)"

Yeah.  He was talking about the ESL students not getting any of his jokes.

"heh, i got a friend who just finished his chem degree"
he's going over to korea to teach english next year
my flatmate is doing a PhD in compusci
he's currently marking exams

I'd love to do a doctorate in OS design.
like IP has a version field that can have a value of "1.0" or "1.1"

"or, convergance avoidance in routing algo's"
avoidance?  That's called "misconfigured RIP"

they were explaining how convergance avoidance is a good thing.
I get paid to fix networks like those.
which had us in histerics
For the consultants pocket book.

"ahh, cvs co done!"

how many friggin computers you got networked together?
"only 12 at the flat, right?"

10 or so at this machien
and then we VPN to about 20 other networks around the place

jbailey: i saw it somewhere :)
thats on the gnu.org site about the hurd IIRC?
a Borg collective of Hurds!
"yeah, that's probably where i saw it :)"
basically IIRC the idea was that since everything was message passing
you could message pass between machines
and get a nice cluster going
yeah
network transparency?
Right now we still need a seperate network card per chroot jail or subhurd. 
would be interesting to play with :)
"well, i'll install GNU/Hurd on my 'new' box i'm getting, 16MB enough ram?"
jbailey: hurd does pty's and slip right?
"chillywilly: Transparent network RPC, yet another wild feature of the Mach microkernel."
"Isomer: ptys, yes.  PPP, yes."
"yes, I know"
so do ppp between them all?
dunno how well i can play with only 16MB of ram
That way your devices could be on another machine.
but it doesn't worj with the current hurd for some reason
"Isomer: I don't have a good idea what the best way to do it would be.  It's a neat thought, though."
thats why I got interested in hurd in the first place
doing precisely that
but I was just going to run multiple pfinet translators
"hmm, can the hurd use an nfs-mounted / ?"
can't you create multiple dummy or tunnel interfaces?
and have a "internal" network going
"chillywilly: don't know, nobody is answering me ;)"
chillywilly: you shold be able to create ppp links over pty's
Isomer: neal had 2 ppp interfaces talking to each other
rigth
that's how he was debugging things
is there any reason that we can run multiple pfinet translators?
you mean can't?
yeah
is there any reason that we can't run multiple pfinet translators?
save ourselves a lot of resources avoiding a subhurd
whats the module for python2-disturils ?
yes you can run multiples pfinets
that's how neal did it
it's built into python2
nite
hmm
you don't need a subhurd
thats what I thought
just set it on 2 different nodes

hrm
sure distutils isn't part of python 2.2
it has been around since 1/5/2
er
1.5.2
hi ladies
apt-get it
dtm: waddup girl
"well, I have python2.0 installed"
and /usr/lib/python2.0/ is populated
sleep time.
Zzzzzz
but I can't see any distutils
ok
I gotta get off
oOo
l8r girlies
You and the trout?
chillywilly: ok later bizitch
see ya!
heh
everyone leaves...
wusses :)
i notice RMS is running for the board of directors for GNOME
yes
brb
back
"damn, can't get hold of parents"
hmm
python-distutils
re
hi all
pwd
howdy
how is everyone on this brisk (at least here) Friday morning (at least here)
boo
you ppl are boooooooring
why don't you do something with your lives?
it's called a job
and it stinks
I got one of those too
hello
hi
whatcha doin' at yo job jcater?
goof off
and eat donuts
tehe
so it is a no-work friday there too?
hmm
I shoulda been a cop
goof off and eat donuts?
that fits the profile
hey reinhard 
"jamest: hi, have you looked at my mails? i need some assistance"
don't eat yellow snow
does that help?
mmm... I want snowcream
you ever eat snowcream
ra3vat: i didn't get them
i think my mail is screwed up
wonder how many lists I'm really getting mail from now :(
i need to run to class could you send a copy to jamest@math.ksu.edu
i put this in cc yesterday and it was bounced :(
"er, i used jamest@gnue.org"
ra3vat: your mails arrived at the gnue-forms mailing list
from what i can tell
"can report it later from home machine, messages are still available in gnue-forms archive"
repost
hi reinhard 
anyone know if you can run Gnome apps on an iPAQ?
chillywilly: not sure
chillywilly: i have seen X running on an iPAQ
iirc gnome developers don't care much about portability
bbl
rofl
if it is i have like one other gauntlet to run on it
and then i think we are able to release
unless you all want me to give it more brutalization 
"but honestly as fun as it is to torture you and jamest, its more fun releasing the stuff :)"
lol
"well, I tortured myself last night"
finding own bugs eh
as I kept trying bizarre combinations of using the form
"yeah, novel idea, eh?"
masochist
you are sick
I know
argh!!!!!!!!
greetings...
madlocke: howdy
how are you doing?
ok again...
"jcater: you are workin' on gnuef too, right?"
"yes, I am"
a special part or just where work is needed?
heheh.. I'm jamest's partner in crime :)
where-ever work is needed
hehe... then i can come with my complaints to you too ;)
madlocke?
is it really you?
madlocke: yes. I'll take complaints as well
hi jamest... yes this time i am writing from germany...
was waiting for my phone company to give me better internet connection ... but think i have to wait more time :(
forms 0.1.0 is coming out this weekend
0.3.0 (the next major release) is the UI rewrite release
i saw already the new version number in cvs ;)
so we would love to get our paws on your code :)
i know we have copyright assignment from you
yep you have...
so I think it's just a matter of making sure your new stuff is
  a) sane (or at least saner than what we have)
i want talk about few things before sending code...
  b) able to support all the leet new features
i would call it ... erm ... evil ;)
the talks or the code?
the code...
"of course it supports already 3d views, a glove, and a support angel..."
... erm... maybe not ;)
:)
so what you want to talk about?
"maybe it is a prob of my configuration here, but:"
when i try to use an account for zipcode.gfd and
i use my normal account that also exists in postgres
it works...
for postgres i have no password defined...
for gnuef i can write any password... it accepts everything...
yes
"when logging in with another user, i.e. root, the account is not excepted..."
yes
this is a postgresql issue
erm.. gr.. not excepted... accepted ;)
argl...
bad...
you have a pg_hba.conf file
where you setup trust for clients
bbs... lunch
a what??? erm... think no
ok.. i see have to look more at postgres...
another thing...
host         all         192.168.1.0   255.255.255.0     crypt  
in that file should make it accept crypted passwords from the 192.168.1 network
ok thanks...
another thing...
otherwise the normal "trust" option just says if the user is in db and the process connecting is owned by that user then it's ok to let him in
yes?
when you write code in UIwxpython
that is used by UIbase
than i think it is a good idea to have
the required things already in a base class
i.e. UILoginHandler
in a base class or as base class ...
madlocke: aggreed
IIRC i started a bunch of little crap in UIwxpython that would be moved to UIbase
but stalled out
ok... then can help you with this as soon as i have cvs write access...
will send you web ui later this day when i am back on windoows...
rock
linux not configured correctly at the moment...
hey!
we can use windows testers too
:)
need some packages and connection too slow and to expensive for this
gotcha
gr.... i want one more monitor..
or some cables... have a monitor switch but no cables... :((
:(
I'll be out part of the weekend
think i will be able to solve this.. ;)
out part? sorry don't understand
so if it's after 5PM my time (now 11:40AM)
I will be away from a computer until late saturday
ah ok...
i get to go play Farmer James 
for the inlaws as the wifes father just had surgery
and they need extra hands to help with the cattle
bad... is hard work i think...
thankfully for them I know which end of the cow the food goes in
grin :)
"of course, that's about all I know about them"
good start
but I look forward to seeing your code
we've got such plans for the new UI
bwahahahaa
to use it you will need Webware from sourceforge.net
is there a list of ideas in a file somewhere?
i don't think so
i keep meaning to start one
"btw, can you remove the old dir from cvs? (inside gnuef... it is empty)"
?
dir called 'old'
;)
i think it is removed
do a cvs update -Pd
to remove unneeded dirs
erm... was checking out everything yesterday... (in a new dir)
"yip, it's not in my cvs updated today"
ok :)
madlocke: how far along is the UI code btw
i knew you had it pulling up forms
but was all the widget support there
it can display most things... the last i did was data exchange... some things work... buttons work...
input lines...
...
"i try with trigger.gfd, helloworld2.gfd, zipcode.gfd"
another gfd that is important?
that is a good start
both zipcode examples would be important
ok...
states.gfd IIRC
and the tourture test 
samples/track/forms/contact_manager.gfd
which really pushes the backend a bit
btw - all the samples in gnuef/samples should work in normal gnuef now
bbiab
ok...
back
did you scrape the event system?
scrap
i looked at some things and have some ideas... did not have a computer in russia... so was a bit difficult to work on it...
have more time now...
ah
we've all been really busy
a bit of funny trivia
we were planning a 0.1.0 release arround November (of 2000!)
so only a year behind
:)
hm... like ms ;)
btw does anyone of you know anything of this mono project?
derek has followed it a bit
i think
"before i went to russia, i played a bit with soap... interesting..."
cu... will be back next week...
booyah
aah!
hey now
only my son can do that
"(and wife, under certain circumstances)"
hehe
too bad
your my bitch for today
I ma a creature of the night
I will drink your blood
putty rocks my socks
ooh
you sicko
sicko?
look who's talking donut man
do you want a donut?
you know you do
"well, yeah"
I have doughnuts
munchkins actually
which is a tradename for donut holes
its madlock
e
btw: mono is crap :)
imho
whyfor?
um because its just a 'copy' of microsoft
and with little gain
let me explain
IMHO .net is many things
one of which is something called C#
when you look at what C# does 98% of it is done in java or python already
thats not a reason not to develope it
thats like saying we already have email programs why make more?
I meuan about c#
so to me C# is nothing more than m$ trying to take java's market share and screw sun
then you have the interoperbility of .net
"which says you write something that can be used by say vb, c, etc all using SOAP"
well ask me
"java / python support soap, corba, etc etc"
true
ad nausem to do this
I'm not satisfied with any object oriented C dialects I've used
so once again its just M$ trying to CONTROL this
the last part of .net i see is the 'passport' thing or 'hailstorm' thing
"that much seems clear, yes"
which i wont even comment on 
bad idea
there is no authority anywhere
but mono basically says they are doing the C# and SOAP thing
which to me is a WASTE
dotGNU on the other hand is doing a passport equiv
now why i dont like passport equiv
i think there is SOME value in trying to make an alterative so microshaft cant control the 'internet' so to speak
dotgnu is doing it all dude
theres already a hailstorm clone
from what i have seen of mono it is basically a linux implementation of what microsoft is doing minus passport
snowstorm or whatever
postable.net is so they can be downward compatible with .NET
portable.nety
which to me is silly and a waste of time
well
but i wont go there :)
mono could be useful
but they will ot cooperate with dotgnu
s/ot/not
I think someone should make a good OO language
chillywilly to me it only appears to give credibility to microsoft
who once controlling hte domain
all the power of C with twice the systems modelling  with half the tedium
will readily shut mono down via legistlature or other means
well M$ does have come clout don't you think?
we need to protect ourselves
just right up front i can see them patenting most of .net
and fscking ximian to all hell
yep
not to MENTION have you seen evolution
that might happen
btw
it looks identical to outlook
dotgnu ppl expect to get sued ny M$
now if Apple can sue all these guys for making 'aqua' themes and shut their asses down
I think that was the idea
s/ny/my
er
what do you think M$ can do to ximian about evolution?
s/ny/by
All my windows friends LOVE Evolution
i mean aqua was just graphics
"evolution 2 outlook is down to look, feel, feature"
ximian tends to just copy M$ though
im sure they have to have 'some patents' on some of that
and if they dont they could readily get them
for example
the way they have the big icons on the left
that is a windowapi thing called an application frame
they were the first to do it
well if they make legal moves against evolution it'll simply change
and gave borland rights to it etc
they patent that
and bam sue ximian to remove it
"The presentation is the only thing they could get ximian on, and thats easy to change."
nickr: yes easy to change but alienate users
basically i will say m$ has done historically fairly well on UI design
i dont think free software has
i wont go naming apps :)
True
at least gui apps
so it would be IMO a big blow to make them redo the evolution GUI
I don't know
I think it could be made different enough yet still very good
ESPECIALLY if the patent violation mandated that evolution be stopped distributed
dneighbo do you see dotgnu and GNUe working together as there has been lots of talk about middleware and forms ui on the dotgnu developers list....of course I mentioned GNUe when this was said
until it was fixed
it could be months
dneighbo: have you tested my changes yet?
"chillywilly i dont care if they choose to work with us or not, im sure they wont"
for us i expect gcomm to encompass that
dneighbo "they" are "us"
:P
chillywilly: you are now?
i.e. if dotGNU has some prop call or procedure stuff gcomm interfaces cna be written to talk to it
ajmitch well I am working on it\
its all about choice
jcater: no dont have cvs access at work
will have to check tongith
dneighbo I just see a lot of areas where dotGNU could use GNUe tools as a base
dunno what will happen though
a small victory on the mac os front
http://alldunn.com/wxPython/stuff/wxMacPython-Demo.jpg 
wxWindows on macOS X
what do you guys think about RMS running for the Gnome Board?
halleluah
"er, wxpython"
"chillywilly: dunno, depends on his motivation"
jcater: i agree
i think he would be good in sense of keeping them on toes
but honestly he is so out of touch with gnome it oculd hurt
I we need RMS there
as his main focus would probably be on the smaller things
think
i.e. i think freedom is important above all else
he's only going to play a political role
but crap most of gnome is LGPL
you know that
so ximian can do what the hell they want with it as can red hat
I trust redhat
guh
ximian I don't trust
so his ability to do 'anything' on that front is limited other than get people mad at him
i would much rather see alan cox on it
well he can't force anything but he can use his influence
as alan is pro GPL
knows kernel space well
and is a good 'engineer' and thusly would help them in many areas IMHO
alan steped down though
i know
i said would RATHER see alan
not we would see alan :)
most gnomies dont care for RMS so i doubt he will be elected in
that's not true
seeing how ximian developers all have votes they probably have over 50 votes
there are some ximian ppl who are also Free Software guys even
and im pretty certain the majority seniment there would be to keep him out
as he is 'bad for business'
Michael Meeks being one of them
chillywilly you misquote me
most gnomies are FSF guys
HOWEVER being a FSF guy != caring for RMS
I didn't quote you
my statement was most gnomies DONT CARE FOR RMS
not most gnomies dont agree with free software
for example mmeeks
i did followup for RMS with him on gnome basic to iron out some details
dneighbo you yourself has said Gnome needs a real "leader"
who better than RMS?
mike said basically tell him i agree to everythign but i refuse to do a webpage on GNU.org and if he cant deal with that to bad im sick of his inane requests
chillywilly: I know you are going to flame me
rms would not make a good gnome leader
chillywilly: but I think RMS is a better "philosopher" that a "leader"
he makes a good free software leader
in sense that its very 'idealistic'
and you can be eccentric and idealistic when peddling philosphy
"well RMS is a consulting philospher, imho and not a ""leader"""
"yeah, what derel said :)"
"derek, even"
HOWEVER to peddle a desktop to the masses and corporate america you need a much different animal
i think the leader for gnome needs to be two things
or they need two leaders
1. big balls
2. lots o patience
(sorry)
one needs a strong vision of where going and how to conquer enterprises (why i dont like him a shining example of this personality is Michael Dell)
jcater btw that equates to your #1 (big balls)
"and the other quality is someone to clean house in the state of engineering, to make dependencies and architectures soudn and sold and enforce good habits (good examples of this are linus and alan with the kernel)"
i still see no reason why rms input should not be felt as the Gnome Board has nothing to do with hacking it is totally political and PR related
jcater btw: this relates to your #2 which is lots o patience :)
lol
dneighbo the architecture is getting a lot better now
an odd question
"another reason why I will not start using KDE, because I believe Gnome is going in the right direction"
but RMS won't even use a web browser last I knew
jamest that totally irrelevant
not really
if the man doesnt even use gnome
refuses to in fact
he must be communicating with ppl some how
its hard to believe he has any clue as to the things going on with in it
chillywilly he uses lynx OCASSIONAL
so I'm not sure he will "get" gnome
he does "get" gnome
how can he "get" it?
he replied to my message once where I call "Linux" a geeks OS and then mentioned Gnome being an effort to make computers easier for regular ppl
he gets that muc at least
that's boilerplate talk
much
i can say the same thing
however if he won't use a browser
and if he still has this emacs/lisp fixation
"(not saying he does, just if)"
then quite a bit of gnome starts to become nothing more than this grey box
"why does that matter you all said that they need to be put in check with regard to freedom iussues, who better to do that thenm RMS...maybe he can get them off of their damn LGPL kick"
I'm not saying he's a bad choice
but I'm not saying he's a good one
he's an interesting one
are you running?
no
i don't get gnome either
what is really scary
is the whole gnuef needs to work in emacs backstory from the fsf
imagine if the same requirements were made of gnome 
:)
huh?
emacs backstory?
the fsf was looking at using gnue for some internal stuff
however the #1 requirement was that all data entry would be via emacs
and all data files had to be maintainable via emacs
what is your point?
I am sure RMS doesn't expect Gnome to run in emacs
My point is that they had no interest in a graphics setup with complex data storage
so? they are old school CLI hackers
"RDBMS, why? just use a ascii file"
right
that is what makes the GNOME thing interesting
so if you support emacs
then they will be ahppy
woppdeedoo
chillywilly: I'll do it if you write geas storage system that puts all data in human readable/editable flat file format
as that was other requirement
chillywilly i dont think you are getting the point
duee
you say they are old CLI hackers
which is the point
OIFML
-> OIF
Object Interchange Format
human readable
old CLI hackers cant expect to understand all the 'issues' of something like gnome or any gui desktop
part of ODMG standard
"chillywilly: wonderfull, now that is your only file format you can use"
i dont think he is a bad choice
btw
just saying he is of value in a single place
"chillywilly: just be sure and whip us up the subsystems required to allow data mining and queries, inserts, locking, etc, etc"
and that is on the political and ethical/moral issues of gnome
jamest all in the standard
and thusly not a good 'comprehensive leader' for the gnome project :)
great!
I'll add emacs ui to the list then 
"i hope he gets on the board, just cause it will be fun to read the meeting notes :)"
what will it say if he does not get on ther board?
"jamest: not only emacs ui, but apparently an emacs dbdriver :)"
that will be a big blow for GNU
"Cambridge may sue Oracle, KPMG for failed system"
"chillywilly: no, it won't"
whats wring with lips?
they might as well rip the GNU out of their name
err lisp
"jcater: nah, we'll use geas's IOF driver"
OIF
this is like 5th failed ERP/CRM suing i have heard of in europe recently
just an interesting note
chillywilly its ALREADY BAD
put it this way
the FSF Manager who took them from 100k in operating revenue to over a Million in operating revenue and assests
and KDE is more politically aligned with GNU/FSF?
was mysteriously let go
he now is the leader of the gnome foundation
i am good friends with them both
and at LWCE in SF
i was used as an 'errand' boy to message things back and forth
becuase the anomosity wsa still so hostile
** PSU please do not include this in the KC ** :)
in a nutshell FSF had some gnome banners
they didnt want to pay shipping and drayage on them and wanted to basically dump them on gnome foundation
but wanted me to relay this 'nicely'
"gnome foundation did blanket thanks but no thanks, we want but have fsf ship to us"
etc etc
so believe me things are 'tense' regardless of teh outcome of this election :)
it mildly reminds me of a couple that married while young and had a few children and found out they had different goals in life
so they decided to split up
only the children force them to have a common bond
so they must regularly cross paths
"heaven forbid gnome should be developed on the basis of providing the best solution...no, it must be a political statement :)"
and at every meeting there is an air of tension and such
if it were a soap opera
FSF is the father
GNOME the mother
the community of developers are the children
GNOME leaves FSF
and soon after shacks up with XIMIAN
XIMIAN and GNOME have a child mono
which makes FSF and some of the community upset
so FSF goes has illegitimate child dotGNU
dotGNU and mono are hostile towards one another
"many of the shared children (community) of GNOME and FSF dont know what to think and some pick sides, some stay neutral, some say mom and dad are nuts"
"now in attempt, FSF is trying to take back custody of first child GNOME"
er wife
GNOME
"sorry, i think this would be a funny story/analog even with specifics :)"
lol
"wow, who gets to keep the dog?"
"and more importantly, the PC"
(s)
"well FSF doesnt have pc, the abacus still works, dont fight it"
as to the dog gnome and fsf decided such luxuries were not compatiable with philosphy of no material possessions
so ximian digitized it and made it an office assistant
 hmm
well the rumor is that ximian has started dabbling in illegal substances (prop software)
and we all know that such things can be habit forming
"i think this is why FSF is getting so mad, he cant stand to see his ex love, gnome being treated this way"
so he is calling for an 'crisis intervention'
wow
dneighbo: think about your example for a second
ok
what are we?
GNOMEs got involved with doing monkeys
the little tramp
huh?
rofl
GNOME was the wife
hooked up with ximian and had babies
isn't that interspecies stuff one of the rumors about the start of AIDS 
well i suppose GNUe and any project of GNU is a concubine of FSF in a sense
"ximians file browser is nice though, wonder when that'll be in the standard gnome"
jcater: we're the unwanted little bastard neighbor kid that keeps breaking windows with our baseball
jamest: thast more accurate
the neighbors kid is fitting (pun intended)
jcater: we also like to watch the monkey loving going on next door thru our telescope
hehe
man there are goats on every corner in gilbert
i finally figured out
"why,"
"it started to bother me, as i was feeling paranoid, but it makes sense when you think like a farmer :)"
"gilbert is huge for dairies, we have like 20 major ones"
dneighbo: look in your backyard
and goats milk is prime source for feeding young calves as supplement for dairy cows
I bet yours got loose
i saw one i must get a picture of for a logo
he was short compact (little but full of muscle)
solid black
with a wicked goatee
and these long horns that were razor sharp
"put a red shirt and a baseball cap on him, and we're set"
that looked like they had been combed backwards
he is at farm on edge of major thoroughfare
most of the goats shy away to the corner in heavy traffic
he stood on top of the dog house almost 'taunting' the car's drivers as they passed by
kind of giving that 'you looking at me?  i know you're not looking at me!" attitude
well off to parent goat conference

I didn't see it anywhere
if other people did then just send it to me

did you send?
jamest: finally yes
cool

jamest@math.ksu.edu?
yes
got it?
back
got it
"ok, read the i18n mail"
ra3vat: i see what you're after
in the code however I'd like to do i18n native
w/o the need for hacks for each language 
the "          elif (1728 <= event.KeyCode() <= 1791):" stuff
as far as the encoding= attribute I see no problems with that
me too
what that native would look like? 
native?
 <jamest> in the code however I'd like to do i18n native
"ah, my bad"
I'd like to support i18n with any i18n features built into the UIs and python itself
maybe via unicode input scanning
on the site.py thing
"so that uiEventTrap need to be rewritten, right?"
is there anyway we can override that setting in common's GBaseApp.py
uiEventTrap needs to go away
it's evil :)
which setting?
Most of the Python distributions I tested define
"ascii" as a default encoding
It blocks any non ascii simbols entered in label's
text in forms (gfd files).
 
Can be changed if manually edit site.py to let
encoding be defined from current locale:
<from ra3vat's mail>
override what setting of default encoding?
override the unicode setting in the code you showed us
but according to site.py setdefaultencoding deleted from namespace
rather than edit site.py
so that we call sys.setdefaultencoding() in GBaseApp at startup
based upon locale info if available
I'll look into it right now
keep in mind I'm talking out my ass as I just read your mail and have done 0 looking into it
jcater: hey now!
i thought you wanted to play with the new mcmillan installer issues :)
"(read as, ""I'll do a quick search on google"")"
ah
jamest: still setting up win computer
it may be done through sitecustomize otherwise
#
# Remove sys.setdefaultencoding() so that users cannot change the
# encoding after initialization.  The test for presence is needed when
"# this module is run as a script, because this code is executed twice."
#
"if hasattr(sys, ""setdefaultencoding""):"
    del sys.setdefaultencoding
 
</site.py>
"yes, I just found that in the module docs "
so we can't get that
however we do have a locale and a unicodedata module
and last thing about encoding parameter in  def initFont(widget):
it looks specific for UIwxpython diver
driver
i figure each driver will have a specific implemention 
but if we could communicate between in backend and UI in unicode 
then I assume we'd be ok
except for the data storage issue
"again, I don't know what I'm talking about "
"ok, i'll look at locale and unicodedata modules"
thanks
oh ra3vat
the not sure if you were hear earlier
but madlocke is back
and we'll hopefully be able to start the UI rewrite real soon now
"yeah, i saw that :) great"

Does anyone have Breaking the Ice.mpg that they don't mind sending over ICQ?
hmm
I'd appericate it alot.

have you connected to this postgresql server from other machines?
I have no other machines at the moment
shouls I check those postgresql files about access control/
did you start postgresql with the -i option (to accept tcp/ip connections)
yes
hmm
you might need to set up pg_hba.conf to accept connections from other machines
I'm looking
$pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf (host based access) controls what addresses are allowed to connect
"by default, it only allows localhost on tcp/ip connections IIRC"
trying
DB001: [C:\PYTHON21\gnue\common\dbdrivers\pypgsql\DBdriver:69] Exection could no
"t create socket: Socket error, no description available.(0x0000273F)"
DB001: [C:\PYTHON21\gnue\common\dbdrivers\pypgsql\DBdriver:69]
what did you put in pg_hba.conf?
"sorry, need to go cu tomorrow"
bye
mdean: thanks
I need to brush up on my postgres
np
wonder if he knows about pgAdminII for Vinders?
hmm
I need to look at that
it's cool - needs a KDE port

it rhymes :)
well he has been for a while
cause he rocks
"aw, a love in!"
"uh, whatever dude"
Ralph Nader is cool
imho
he "gets" Free Software
chillywilly: ok so that was a little over the top ;)
chillywilly: yeah it's kinda cool to see politicians "get it" eh?
yea
Nader is well spoken but i dont' know if i should comment on American politics
believe me you won't day anything we don't already know
s/day/say
ja 
we canadians watch all american news anyways (at least i do)
"The level of fines that would serve as a

Microsoft has indicated it strongly opposes as a threat to

<derek> we need a new homepage
(no further comment)
reinhard: why?
plz don't get me started
we had a cool static homepage under www.gnu.org/projects/gnue
and we had a cool mailing list at gnue@gnu.org
but that wasn't enough for us
we needed 15 new mailing lists (of which >= 12 are completely dead)
and we needed a hyper super dynamic homepage
(where an average of 1-2 articles per month are posted)
well i have to add that we had 3 or 4 versions of that dynamic homepage
yeah
and now i hear
"we need a simple (static?) homepage"
hehe
"i don't really care about the homepage, i care about the code :)"
me too :)
so I _don't_ adivse you to read the logs to see what position I took in the homepage discussion :)
"this was quite awhile ago, i guess?"
um yes several months :)
"hmm, i probably wouldn't be able to find it ;)"
"they hardly ever get used, from what i see"
exactly
but we needed that because we will have so many developers
"will have, but it's not needed now"
yeah and we needed a dynamic web page because of the many articles people will post
heh
and we couldn't understand that rms is anti dynamic pages
:)
"what mailing lists are actually used, btw?"
officially you could mail to all of them
most of the subscriber lists are nearly identical :)
hehe

hi
did you get derek fixed up on that form monday night?
hi
jamest: not really
can you gentlemen see http://f-c-c.com or http://foundationcourseconsulting.com ?
haven't been able to gnue too much
jamest: how's the weather in KS
dtm: 
:)
The site you have requested doesn't exist. 
The associated domain name has probably been reserved by a client from GANDI then parked.

ok thanks :/
interesting coz foundationcourseconsulting.com has always worked
oh
i'm on it :)
i just switched f-c-c.com to my nameserver
jamest: no form fixage
ok
first we must verify there is a real problem :)
taco bell needs to rename their "Win it before you can buy it" x-box sweepstakes
to "Win it before you can buy it but receive it a week after you could have bought it" x-box sweepstakes
as we're one week away from retail rollout and their sigh keeps saying "come back real soon for the list of winners!"
sigh=site
something funny
they are claiming huge interest in the x-box
"Xbox.com brought in 589,000 unique visitors during the week ended Oct. 28, soaring 71 percent from the previous week"
"now I wonder if that may have, in some remote way, and I'm only guessing here, been due to the fact that you had to visit xbox.com to register your !@#!@# game piece and the last day to enter was the 29th of Oct"
be back tonight
later all
hi
Howdy.
"hey, haven't seen you before, checkin out GNUe?"
"Yep, couple of days ago - I recognized your nick."
"ahh, I might not have been around then"
"East coast, right?"
"or maybe my memory has failed, which does happen heh"
yeah NC
you
?
I'm in Hawaii - it was 3 AM when you logged out.
"ahh I think I recall now, talkin about hiking in Hawaii right?"
"Yep, and the inheriting from other languages?"
Like the M$ CLR does?
I'd like to go 4 wheelin and hike/camp in hawaii one day.. I dunno if they have public 4 wheelin areas tho.. I know some people 4 wheel there tho.. 
"Not a lot of 4wheel areas, a few, tho."
I might have been away during that part of the conversation ;-)
Yeah - know how it goes.
Mr_You: working on any of the GNUe stuff?
"not programming, mainly an end-user/developer of Form applications.. trying to get a custom Debian based distro first then will start working on GNUe"
hi jwserra
hi
This is all very interesting stuff. How far along is gnue?
"still alpha, but coming along"
I hear 2 tier apps are in production
Should one try to setup a system from cvs or just download the last release?
I have heard to use the cvs version
as of today
I imagine a release might be coming up soon (as in a month or who knows)
but I recall someone stating multiple changes between the latest release and cvs
I suppose I can find all the info in the install docs right?
Hewlett-Paquard has released an entire web service framework as open source: E-speak.
"jwserra: well I dunno... if you have probs, hang out here, someone is always willing to help you get running (assuming someone is here/available and knows how to fix your problem), but most of the developers are here frequently and like to help you get started if you have problems"
I think it is GPL'ed.
have a url tiger?
cool thanks
I think its awesome these big corps are GPLing software
"Me, too. I spent 6 month building a framework when all this was new, and HP's looks pretty good."
They had a lot more resource to put into than we did.
its interesting to find out what "web services" platform will gain the most market share
Umhm . . . but part of the beauty of it is - doesn't matter: whose Ethernet card has the biggest market share?
As long as you have a working interface . . . 
e-Speak is 'GPL for the run-time engine and LGPL for the programming library API'
Just found that on their site.
What is LGPL again - 'lesser'
?
yeah
well.. what I mean is that.. usually the one with the most market share is the best one.. ;-)  atleast as far as open source goes ;-)
An people(corporations) are starting to open source their app servers too!
Oh - got ya!
"Well, I've looked into the 'market share' thing a bit, and I don't think many people have actually gotten that far with it yet."
I agree
hafta wait and see
all you can do is use what works in the mean time
And what seems appropriate for your organization.
"6,642 developers .. geez heh"
"6,642?"
thats what it says for e-speak.net under site statistics
I read that the HP family doesn't want the Compaq and HP merger to happenn
Read that too.
sounds good to me
"Yeah, seems to make sense in the current market."
"HP is open sourcing their app server, to, according to this: http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/22671.html"
"IBM just open source 40 mil buck worth of web service development tools, too."
Thats what they say it cost them to develop them.
yeah
use cvs
thats what I thought
"i think you can expect a release of forms, designer, and common (all at 0.1.0) before the start of next week"
and the more people testing cvs before the release the better :)
sweet
plus the cvs is far nicer than last release
Can we use Forms against Postgres?
oh yeah
yeah thats 2-tier rock
"we support popy, pygresql, pypgsql, psycopg drivers for postgresql"
okey-dokey - will look into it.
in cvs
"yep, I'll take that advice, too."
I'm new to GNUe is their a GUI-based form design tool?
yip
designer
"'is there', sorry"
the quick and dirty setup guide to gnue cvs
Way cool!
check it out
then
cd gnuef
python setup.py devel
cd ../designer
python setup.py devel
Python! yay!
this will get you the "uninstalled"  version
gfcvs - runs forms
"oh james, nov 4th has come and gone any word from madlocke?"
gfdes - runs designer
not a peep
i think if we don't hear anything by the weekend we'll call it a loss :(
as 0.3.0 of forms is the UI rewrite release
and there will not be a 0.2.0
why? oh..
so once 0.1.0 hits the wire we'll move forward
you have cvs write?
"well.. I say we still make one or two more attempts to atleast get the code and look at it.. I could hack at it, or learn from it"
me?  heh nah
i have and older copy that the new stuff is based upon
it's the pre-rewrite rewrite :)
cool
but it didn't support the web interface
you seen that web forms deal?
what? where?
lemme find it
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/
chilly found it
RockTiger: while I'm thinking about it
designer does support everything forms can do
what do you think about XForms?
mainly themaster/detail forms have to be setup by hand
the designer can manipulate them once setup
"Mr_You: i looked once but don't recall details, lemme check it out quickly"
"also, what widgets does Forms have now?  "
jamest: I like the idea of integrating audio or video with X-Forms
jamest: Thx.
lol
m$ germany offers a prize for the best case study of a linux to windows migration
anybody remember my former signoff message?
first they ignore you
then they laugh at you
then they fight you
:)
"mock, ridicule, brawl"
:)
sounds like m$ tactics
"""Hi.  Yeah, I'm an MSCE consultant from Luffenwaffin"""
I don't see a signoff from you in my scroll back
"I noticed that by switching my Linux using customers to Windows"
"I was able to increase my support revenue by 300%"
Mr_You: former == 2 months ago
sorry if that is bad English
i remember it reinhard
jamest: lol
sigh
http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/nt2linux/
"""Hi, Im an MCSD/MCSE + Internet from Lustenau"""
just happen to come across that
"Getting a 30% discount on licensing and being able to wrap that back into my cost at 100% cost gets me serious revenue with little work."
dneighbo: :)
"""In addition to that, when I developing using your recommended 3rd party components and databases, I am able to pick up additional licensing revenue markup's as well"""
"your new 'pirate protection' initiatives are really helping me as I am able to give a 'good' reason why my clients should pay for licenses
"A completely unexpected yet very positive side effect of the migration involved most of my customers in-house IT quiting soon after the migration."
"My consulting revenues have gone thru the roof!"
"""The best effect I have seen is that the customers are having so much trouble with the operating system, they barely call me anymore about bugs in my software.  Since your support is so poor, I get additional 'operating system' support revenue"""
"""I can truly say economically, this has been a great migration for my customers"""
did you guys catch my xbox site stat comment earlier
about the increased traffic on xbox.com
"""Two threatened to leave because they were frustrated, but when they spoke to the folks in Luffenwaffin, they confirmed this is 'normal' and you 'get used to it', since then all is well"""
"""Microsoft thank you for bringing the American Dream to Austria, we love M$!"""
hehe
what i like best is when customers tell me
"""my [Windows] system is surprisingly stable, it crashes only twice a week or so"""
:)
rock solid baby
yesterday my boss got 'memory allocation errors' the other programmer here asked 'when was last time you rebooted?
i started cackling over the cubicle walls
i added 'its only funny cause its a valid question'
sure enough a reboot fixed it :)
dneighbo: wrong
dneighbo: a reboot removed the symtpom
symptom
:)
hi all
got an interesting e-mail 
as a result of the 1st Kernel Cousins GNUe
theres a kc gnue?
that's a cue for someone to say "tell us about it psu..."
oh there it is
nickr - hidden in the list across the top
not on the main list yet
test about it psu
please i want to know :)
aha!
e-mail from a guy in Brussles
he has persuaded a 
large private company
to GPL its HR/Payroll 
system
Are we interested?
possibly
we would like to talk to him
the biggest problem is we want our architecture
not something that is 'fixed' or 'hardcoded'
BUT
agreed
shall I fwd mail to you
the nice thing about such things is it gives us a base requirement
or to one of the other guys?
i.e. implement the fuctionality in GNUe architecture
yes
of course if he wanted to GPL it we could put under GNUe umbrella regardless if he liked
send the email to info@gnue.org
"also, I suppose problems "
then it will go to appropriate folks
if they have used any non-free s/w 
"psu: yes, im leary at best about such things"
to help write it.
but i dont like to count things out
ok.
if it's technologically incompatible
maybe it becomes our first test for GNUe Integrator
"(oops, forget I said that)"
:-)
why
it makes some sense :)
first rule of the army & GNU -
never come up with any ideas
Integrater?
or
or someone will suggest you do it
rofl
"of course, I should be safe"
this is true
as IANAP (i am not a programmer)
and your wonderful for volunteering to start integrator
and so diligent about it too :)
so when does next gnue kc come out :)
weekly? monthly?
weekly
I have 80-90% of the next one written
depending how much you all talk the next two days ;-)
Monday was 137k
of log file
"some excellent stuff in there, however."
what is GNUe Integrator?
omg you quoted me
i quote everyone
gotta spread the fame/blame/shame/whatever
"AFAIK, Integrator is the module "
"hmm I'm not quoted, but the statement from me isn't entirely accurate, but no big deal"
that allows you to integrate 
"Instead, he was looking to customize Interchange to provide a web shopping cart using PHP."
stuff that doesn't fit the GNUe architecture
at all
cool
Integrator is a GNUe Tool that will allow you to merge disparate data
Mr_You - I can actually resubmit if there's anything major wrong
jcater is a good example
he has an existing financial (accounting) package
part of the problem with IRC is there's less context
but is going to do inventory etc in GNUe
"psu: ehh nah, its got enough buzz words to get someone in here to ask ;-))"
so I'm bound to make a serious boo-boo eventually
integrator woudl allow him to configure a 'map' from one to the other
and run it in batch or real time
the old fashioned way to do this
would be - 
export text file from source app
frig around with it using 
"perl, SQL, COBOL (no joke), whatever"
then load into target system
and hope it all works
"old fashioned" - earlier this year
in my case anyway
"yeah, if someone wanted to hack together Interchange and GNUe that would be a good spot for it I guess.."
yip that is old way :)
also know as contrib 
new way is 
have integrator build an xml def of source a and source b
visually match one field to antoher and apply rules
save definitions and rules
and use at will
what's will ever done to upset you?
v old joke
sorry
huh?
"fire at will"
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/Integrator/
explains a bit
"psu: in regards to mdeans ""new Release"" is more specificly about his dcl app not GNUe, but coincidentally GNUe seems to also have a release coming"
dont think its teh 'final' direction we will go but its general idea
psu: i think you did exceptional job for being new to gnue on the kc
some minor inaccuracies like the one Mr_You is pointing out
Mr_You - I'm going to issue a "clarification" next issue 
but over time i think it will iron itsefl out :)
trans. I fubared up
hopefully you have been getting your notes :)
second one is much easier alredy
we have been dropping them in log as we see fit
BTW:
i have a lot to html converter
that will be very nice for you :)
"psu: sounds good, I would say all you need to do is add ""DCL (Double Choco Latte)"" to it and be done, IMO"
i will make it so you can also insert anchors so in teh KC you can link right to the spot in the log
also it was designed to allow message drops and topic filtering
thanks dneighbo
so you can do
**EMAIL psu**
"hey do foo please, thanks -d"
**END EMAIL**
and it would emai you that
or
k()()l
**GEAS**
some stuff
other stuff
**END GEAS**
"psu: I may have missed it, but how long til there is a GNUe mailing list on there?"
and then it would create a geas.html that only had lines in all the geas tags
Mr_You - when there is actually some traffic
there were issues with how to best do that
I am theoretically covering all the GNUe lists I can find 
funy
as you have cross topic stuff
as well as IRC
and people forget to use topics etc
which is why i gave up on it
but i still have the code :)
so i will play with it again
dn - part of joy or IRC is that you can start talking one thing 
and onto another 
without even realising
oddly enough i hacked in my hotel room at LWCE NY last year :)
I can always retrospectively "designate" "threads" anyway
i called the original file logger.py
Mr_You - there is an email thread next issue
and then got childish on the plain and couldnt stop lauging at the name logger :)
for those that dont know logger = childish slang for a large turd
I thought a logger was someone who loged
logged
that too :)
eg a lumerjack
lumbejack
& i'm OK
lumberjack even
"most lumber jacks do produce 'loggers', i think its the pancakes :)"
maybe its a redneck child thing to call big turds loggers (thusly why i thought i should clarify)
dneighbo: you are sick
"Reinhard said that James Thompson had started it, ""but has been mad goat raped in the middle of the development process"". "
:)
psu : what were we saying about topics again?
bahahah!
"KC guidelines say don't swear, but don't cut other's swearing"
I was only obeying guidelines
hahaha
psu: huh?  I was refering to a mailing list that would send the kc for GNUe to my mailbox
Mr_You - don't know about that 
I assume it is covered by whatever functionality 
Zack has set up for the other KCs
dn - if people can put topic markers 
in the log it would be helpful
"ok, I might just try a blind email, its not on the site yet"
but since I need to read the whole log anyway
doesn't matter if they forget
anyone decided on a format for topic markers?
could be as simple as 
TOPIC: Goats
"hey psu are you reading this?" 
works for me
TOPIC: goat rape
PSU: goats
"well, to me, it looks like the first IRC-based Kernel Cousin was a success ;-)"
yep
It does seem a little more um crazy than the list based ones
ta muchly
But its very useful
nickr - I think that reflects the medium
the medium is the message
Indeed
it gives someone the ability to go back and read the entire conversation or some incentive to contact us to find out more
its like recording meeting minutes
sorta
Mr_You - very similar in fact
except at meetings not everyone talks at the same time
"(oh, I don't know, though...)"
heh
Meetings also tend to have fixed agendas
TEND to
meetings don't tend to discuss goats or trout
TEND to ;-)  
this is one long meeting heh
one long rambling meeting with no doughnuts and lots of farmsex
ahem
heh
MOTTO!
hehe
i think we should after every KC release
a. post the summary part as a news story with a link to the KC
b. notify linuxtoday
c. mail a version the discuss list
this way all bases covered
yea
sounds godo
I can do all that.
"AFAIK, linux today carries all KCs automagically"
but I could be wrong
"it sure does, cause there it is! ;-)))"
psu: but didnt you 'submit' that KC?
or was it auto done?
Kernel Cousin GNUe #1 by Peter Sullivan 
"(Nov 6, 2001, 15:03 UTC) (1701 reads) (0 talkbacks) (Posted by mhall) "
"""Welcome to the first issue of KC GNUe! Thanks (I think!) to Jeff Bailey for persuading me to volunteer for this, and to Zack Brown for his help and patience in sorting out my first draft. This Cousin will cover the IRC channel for GNUe (and some mailing lists as well). For more information about the GNU Enterprise project, see their home page..."" "
"After battling to stay alive, Eazel succumbed to market conditions, and on May 15 it closed its doors for good. If this were the world of closed-source software, this event would have been devastating to customers."" "
"dn - I submitted the announcement, but not the KC itself"
if Eazel *had* paying customers they might still exist ;-)
InfoWorld must need clicks
Mr_You why is that
"A local firm, QSP just went under"
they wrote accounting software & provided it ASP
all their clients are currently still have their servers kept running 
by the administrator
but are feeling very nervous
in  a hypothetical future
if they were using a GNUe Application Service Provider
they could switch tomorrow
even take their "special modules" 
written by the ASP 
as long as they have been GPL-ed as well
"In fact, would they not have to b?"
dneighbo: I just don't care for the articles scenario
Eazel seemed like a bad example.. 
that example seems better to me
now QSP have been taken over by another firm
instead they picked on open-source
guess what "mandatory upgrade" is coming next?
Mr_You i agree and disagree
http://uk.biz.yahoo.com/011101/183/ce5c1.html
i think nautilus is a shining example of how in free software world a good product lives even if its company dies
note to psu - continution of thread from Mon 05 Nov
"i think it is a bad example of customers not getting the shaft, as eazel had no customers, therefore they had no one that would have been shafted :)"
actually it freed nautilus from its bondage lsort of
same if ximian died today
derek: yeah.. 
their software would live on im sure
but i dont think they have any 'customers' in sense of word 'customer' so no one is screwed
exactly
both nautilus and ximian do have 'end users' that are/wouldnt be hosed if the companies folded and that is valuable information
:)
i think psu's sample is MORE powerful in the sense that you can say look at this REAL WORLD situation where PAYING customers are left with fate hanging in the balance
IF it had been free software like ....insert package here... it could exist w/o the company (one that comes to mind outside nautilus is greatbridge (postgresql)
psu: for the record i think most of GNUe developers are pretty much against the notiion of ASP's
"obviously one could use GNUe for an ASP, but its not something we intend to encourage much"
yeah.. I think thats what infoworld is probably going for (didn't read the entire article) but putting an open-source company known like Eazel might get more hits than a no name
i think it was a 'positive' article really
as it was trying to say even though some 'big name' linux companies are dying the software remains strong
dn - I think you're right
"at least initially, orgs interested in GNUe "
will also be interested in running them itself
"as with demise of eazel, and linuxcare/valinux on the ropes a lot of FUD is being used saying Linux is dead look at thier 'wall street darlings'"
this article i think was meant to counter such FUD though possibly not in the most 'effective' manner
"I think software as a service will still continue to process on the local (LAN) side, but with WAN integrated with a service provider."
isn't the new GPL 3.0 meant to have something re. ASPs
Mr_You i agree
 i think most shops except very small ones
will want something like gnue in their own control
but might use it like an ASP to smaller affiliates of thiers
so the home office houses 'super GNUe'
and the remote offices get reduced access via web to some critical yet not as intense things
if you are sufficiently afflicted by FUD over running your own financial apps
you will probably have too much FUD to use GNUe anyway
most true :)
early GNUe adopter = cluefull
typical ASP cutomer = clueless
"(descriptive, not insultative)"
is that a word?
"well I would say the adopter doesn't need so much clue, cause it will just run and run and run, the integrator will need clue"
FUD is a powerful thing
comes in words like "reference sites"
insultive seems like a useful word
"experience in the industry"
all subsitutes for working out whether your integrator/supplier knows their onions
The Idea of ASPs seems like a good one
if there are ratings and assurances
the idea is ok
the problem is 
a. risk
b. reality
I would find it frustrating knowing every time I wanted 
"something changing, I have to renegotiate SLA"
most people throw b out the door but most good companies are reasonably concerned about a :)
or rely on goodwill
"With in-house IT, I just need to persuade the IT director "
that what I want to do is reasonable.
the most poignant example i have is
"if i buy package a from vendor a, he tell me upgrade or you dont get support"
YES!
if i really dont like his new package i can continue to use the old one and just not have support (which i probably never had anyhow)
BUT
if im an ASP customer
"(in big, Ben-Hur title style lettering)"
the son of a bitch over night can upgrade me 
and im screwed
"dn - that's their business model, of course"
"economies of scale, everyone the same set up"
dneighbo: assuming their architecture forces that situation
now granted we can have a contract that makes it so he has to warn me and i get a choice etc etc
There's definitely the need for an infrastruture of agreements to prevent ad things like that from happening
(not telling you anything you don't know...)
but now its not an ASP its simply a co-locatino that im overpaying for :)
pretty much ;-0
)
nickr: my point being i can name like 40 situations like this
and the answer is always well make a contract so you cant do that
Indeed.
and my point is that then its not an ASP
dneighbo: i think meanwhile microsoft can upgrade your pc over night without letting you know even without being ASP
its a consulting house / software vendor / where you just choose to use their hardware :)
only if you leave it swiched on
psu: true :)
reinhard : sadly i think that is their goal
which isn't likely with Windows
psu: and especially only if you have windows installed ;)
need to clear down all the memory leaks
the thing is ASP's make sense for SOFTWARE VENDORS
its easier to 'control' the customer
you control the hardware
the software versions
the data
etc etc etc
known bugs
GNUe is intended to be the opposite of control
"however, 90% of all consulting jobs i have been on the NUMBER ONE complaint is the customer felt they had no control with current vendor and wanted out"
thats why we started GNUe
this is why free as in speech is more important than free as in beer
its 'ultimate' control
for GNue
psu ABSOLUTELY :)
psu: couldn't agree more
"and why most gnue developers are anti ASP, for the simple reason we feel it removes freedoms of end users most of them not 'understanding it' until its too late :)"
GNUe Hosting is better ;-)
"actually, most medium/large finance s/w vendors"
are probably above average in giving access 
now im sure there will be a few gnue asp's that come around
some might even be successful
"not necess to source, but to info"
i dont doubt that there is a market for companies
"not saying much, probably"
that really dont want to 'care' about IT at all
but there's a world of difference between 
and do want someone else to control it all w/o much input
a private customisation which will break with the next upgrade
what about a company that is basically an external IT dept?
i think its a SMALL percentage though as the ASP's that are going under are quickly finding out
and just checking out & customising the "GNUe Weird & Wacky Requirements" module
thats not considered an ASP is it?
"nope, thats the problem :)"
ASP you cant customize :)
really
but to each their own
that was one of teh culture shocks 
at my old company when they started selling ASP
the biggest one i have gotten from companies about ASP
salesmen used to saying "yes" to everything 
& adding in the cost of the customisation
is "NO FRIGGIN WAY IM PUTTING MY FINANCIALS ON A MACHINE I DONT OWN"
suddenly the ASP people were saying NO
the ultimate no-no for salesmen
Hrm
"i.e. at one company, the CEO was all hot on using an ASP (from FUD)"
basicly all an ASP is: packaged software accessed within the web-browser eliminating the need to maintain backups or hardware
we discussed what that meant and him and the account after realizing it meant putting data outside their network said 'what idiot company would do that' end quote :)
"Mr_You : shining example, say you use greatplains"
what about a company that manages a computer inside your company as a delivered service?
which assuredly will use passport
and passport was just hacked
and ewallet with it
passport is a joke
now your company data is available to the world
now thats not to say your 'data' isnt secure when not in an ASP but its a HELL of a lot more secure even if its not
The following information was not given:
oops
let me give you an example
you can have an insecure system
but theoritically only random hacker or a competitor will try to 'crack' it
probably fairly low probablility
you go to a large ASP w/ say 500 customers
much more likely target of a cracker
hacker sees "KICK ME" sign
yes
and once they have cracked the system they will have access to all 500 custom data
"cracker, sorry ;-)"
so even if thier security is better theoritically it is being attacked more often probably by higher level of cracker :)
"unless an ASP does EXTREMELY thorough security audits *regularly* then you have a huge risk, which is why it should only be used for really small biz at a really cheap price"
also most companies only expose key data to the 'net' rarely
but anyhow i think most of us are in agreement here
or for a large start-up that needs to be up next Tuesday
but then most of these are jt ventures
so one of the partners can provide financials
regardless of security etc my primary knock on ASP's are they remove 'freedom' from their users which is bad IMO
you could layer your arch. so that GNUe lies on the local side with isolated wan services to a service provider for additional services.. ie. a VPN
Mr_You thats what we are starting to do now
setting up ssl postgres as well as setting up a freeSWAN VPN
and testing forms with it
so you could have WAN capabilities
of course when geas is ready we woudl do with geas opposed to the db
cool
how's geas going?
"ssl postgres is a solution but year I'd rather use a VPN, or limited ssl web access"
s/year/yea/
+ GEAS
you could have geas/db as a provided service?
"yeah, using a VPN"
or (eventually) do DB replication between multiple sites via VPN.. (just a guess/dream)
;that'd be cool
storage provider
if you had several then if one went out of usiness or something you'd be okay
Mr_You that would be best end game for large sites
thank you ;-)
real time replicatoni of geas objects as well as database data
one day
this way they can use local servers at locations for speed
but if one node or another fails
offsite backup in secure datahaven in a salt mine in romania?
"yup, and additional functionality.."
they have dual location instant backup for no loss in business
servers consolidation will continue.. companies save money with less machines.. in the future one or two machines will have multiple virtual private servers with different services with added security
gonna get some late lunch bbl
s/servers/server
argh
hi all
howdy
ahoy
I feel yer pain
apt is simply the way things should be
theres lots of dependanceis too
Isomer surely you jest
:P
how many of the frontends work so far?
attempt installing gnucash on a rh6.2 machine w/o ximian (or even with ximian) and you will understand the true meaning of 'dependency' 
same goes for evolution etc etc etc
to be fair to gnucash
try doing it from a box without X
and watch the dependancies climb!
:)
perhaps you should have a page with links to all the dependancies that you are likely to need?
perhaps you should use apt
no-one has packaged gnue for debian yet?
"well, this box is RH7"
and apparently noones packaged it at all
unlessy ou count .tgz as a package :)
I'm shocked and dismayed
not sure what version of GNU
e
ah
funky
gaes 0.0.6
but thats all I see in sid
Isomer: frontends are currently only wxpython
the curses one is broken
the html one isn't in cvs
"as for the dependency page, we did start putting them in downloads"
but kinda dropped the ball and don't have them all up there :(
"also, wrt the frontends, 0.1.0 of forms will be out this week"
then the focus shifts back to the frontends
ahh
cool
the form designer doesn't do much? or am I being stupid?
cvs version or release?
which one you running?
http://www.oddtodd.com/
requires flash
the one in tgz's on the website in the downloads area
"ah, that designer is old and is little more than framework"
looks nice 
you definately want the cvs stuff
but not overly functional :)
we're about to release 0.1.0 of it as well
you have access to cvs?
"also, i assume you're running on a *nix system"
is that right?
yeah
I'm on a RH7.1 box
I'll go co it
ok
"the plan is to show the boss something neat, we start doing projects with it, then he pays me to code on it :)"
keep everybody happy :)
yea! ;-)
:)
Isomer: what you working on?
I work for a company that does a lot of web based projects for companies
"ranging from ecommerce -> various business apps (eg: Timesheet, TODO etc)"
mostly in php
Isomer we had rpms at one time
"technically with setup.py its not hard to create, should be included with next release"
as for debians they are on the way
geas debian exists
cool
the rest are in development by jbailey
designer even the old one tgz was VERY functional to me
not intuitive at times
but still very useful (for editing existing forms)
what widgets does forms have right now?
the cvs version is more intuitive and the BIG plus is it has WIZARDS to build forms directly from dbs
label and text
so in like 5 minutes
:)
sweet :)
you can have fully functional db aware unix/win32 app
man
however it has different styles of those :)
label
dropdown
edit
checkbox?
checkbox
textarea?
textarea
ok
fake grids :
:)
caffeine is kickin in
not good heh
cool!
this script is frustratin me
Isomer: most of these are variations of a <entry> widget
gnuef has a very basic set of widgets
are multiple forms within a single forms client capable?  and how about launching another forms client?
"no, yes"
"wait, that's not true"
"yes, yes"
hehe cool
"man, i hate windows"
so you can do master/detail relationships?
"ok, so yes you can create menus to other forms and yes you can launch another forms client from a menu?"
Isomer: yes
very very sweet
but designer form wizard doesn't support autocreation of them yet
what i do
create two forms in desginer
merge them with the needed tag changes
then use designer to fix up the layout
cool
as designer itself has no problems with master/deatil only the wizzard has issues
Mr_You: no menu alterations yet
that's part of the UI rewrite
Isomer: i have to leave soon
did you get cvs ?
it's still CO'ing
I should have -z9'd it :)
I'm sure I can figure it out
ok
thanks for your help :)
no problem I'll try and be on tonight
:)
where are you located at?
ah ha! just finished the co
I'm in New Zealand
it's currently 11am
TOPIC: GNUe Forms Client (preceeded)
more NZrs!
heh
the 3 dirs of interest (at least for forms)
gnuef
gnue-common
desginer
install gnue-common first
then forms
then designer
yep
done that already from the tgz's
then
you're set :)
hrm
it wants me to upgrade python now :/
whoops
"crap,crap,crap"
i completely forgot about that
0.1.0 will require python2.x
argh!
and hope that comes with python2 :)
i must leave now
sorry
i'll be back later
np :)
bbl 
hi hemun_nan 
oops wrong channel
nite all
does gnome have a database "object"?
howdy y'all\
howdy
"dneighbo: did jamest get to look at the master/detail form today, or do I still need to look at it?"
dont think he did
you might want to look at it
you know if he'll be back on tonight?
he said he was going to try
exit
hehe
chillywilly: HIDAN
hey dude
got your email
yep
gravy
i've been reading the book of Daniel
so how's it going
i read somewhere that males go through monthly hormonal cycles but i have no idea what that's all about
"i dont know if it's the same time every month or why it is,etc"
what symptoms to look for
kinda weird
MOST UNUSUAL.
dtm: I've read that too
but don't recall where
hmm!
therefore it must be true!!
:)
How very queer.
Well I'm glad for that!
haha
hey you know what's another weird biological life cycle thingie that The Man doesn't want you to know about?!!  perimenopause
we have your time of the month too?
women get it of course.
"er, our"
"chillywilly: yeah, apparently!"
"right, jcater?"
yes
perimenopause is nutty coz it occurs from age 30-45 and is way misunderstood and misdiagnosed
hmmm
but it's serious.
"the reason why doctors called the removal of the uterus a hysterectomy, is because it used to be considered a cure for ""hysteria"""
obviously.
i dont know if it really works.
maybe it does in some cases.
i'd think it'd l;eave ya feeling kinda hollow!
it is an old suoerstition
superstition even
so did you like that email dan
uh sure
:)
'sup dawg?
hey
found a bug
so did I
(from derek's form :( )
wassat?
modal dialog (login) choaks on windows 
but the code is correct
<sigh>
i locks on the 2nd call to ShowModal()
i have workarround
what's your bug
master/detail
ARGH!
"in forms, if you create a new record in a master block"
it automatically creates a new record in detail block
but when you commit
that seems right
it then fills in the primary key in the master
and commits the master
then commits the detail
(without first setting the detail's foreign key)
sigh
you working on a fix?
yes
BUT
one caveat
"you need to use a pre-commit (or pre-insert, or whatever it's called) trigger to populate the master's primary key"
not a postgresql automatic incremented field
or forms won't know what the key is
?
"in derek's example, "
the pygresql driver requeried automattically
so the primary key was available
"oh, it does"
wtf is a foreign key?
I mena like where do you usually use one?
it's a key that's only allowed in the db with a proper work visa
lets say you have a db called states
  state_code char(2)
  description varchar(30)
then in your customer db
"oh, ok"
  you have a state_code field that is a foreign key
crappy example but the idea is there
"jcater: oh, it does?"
a pointer to another table right?
dtm: ?
I want my Gnu-uu-e
=)
mdean: hi
"mdean: jbiggers's baby is ok, just a bump"
should I bitch slap him?
"er, miguel"
chillywilly: now's your chance!
dtm: howdy - cool aboot the baby
mdean: yeah
whew
I don't like miguel and his anti-GNU attitude
chillywilly: miguel is an eccentric one
where's he get his money?
why do we always hurt the ones we love?
"ximian, that is"
mdean: :'-{
mdean: ?
what is ximian's income?
chillywilly: you don't love Miguel?
ximian can kiss my arse
hell no
chillywilly: mdean is saying that MIGUEL DOESN'T WANNA HATE   !!   HE ONLY WANTS TO LOVE.....   HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW *HOW*!!  :'-{
I feel like starting shit with him evertime I see him enter #gnome
Miguel is my anti-hero
mdean: hehe
chillywilly: be careful
why?
they can ban me if they want
obvious reasons
I don;t give a crap
what good is it if you get banned?  then you can't talk normally there
we're all in the same community
whether we all fully reckanize or not
well we only have 2 gnome dependencies
ORBit and glib
so what
so I havn't done anything anyway
:)
I said I would *like* to bitch slap him
"let's not have aggression amongst brethren, regardless of who started what :"
:)
chillywilly: yeah and you said more than that :)
well dude if we had mono and dotgnu cooperation then maybe I wuld think more highly of miguel
but when he uses the glibc release notes to take a shot at RMS and uses it to justify being a code nazi he can kiss my butt
you don't want mono
i acknowledge that there may be reasons to not be entirely appreciative of ximian's/miguel's efforts :/
chillywilly: yeah
mdean: yeah i thought i was pregnant once for a whole year
turned out it was mono
rofl
or maybe i was just bored
chillywilly: dan you could throw your significant other at Miguel.
er?
use her like a projectile against a giant bowling pin
why would I do that?
and say "SO THERE!"
"chillywilly: i only say that because the last time i saw ya gettin riled up , it was about her"
so 
just tryin to be helpful
"yea, well that was yesterday"
dont mean ya dont lub em
mdean: how are you doing sir?
000101001001010110111000
what number is that
?
the good one
dtm: peachy
mdean: no way
mike have you ever been unpeachy?  at least in the time i've known ya?
sounds yucky
chillywilly: no!
yes!
a;jflsjwp9o
it doesn't pay toi argue with me
I always win
;P
noted!
"dtm: if you do: piMike->get_Status(BSTR* pVal) and look at the code, you'll find: *pVal = m_bstrPeach.Copy();"
HAHAHHAHAkjwlekjwlk
lol
!!
cookies?
sticks it in the cookie file
:)
Isomer: get cvs copy running?
nah
I need to upgrade python
and I think thats going to take a while :)
so I won't do that on work hours :)
sorry about that
they just uploaded 2.1.1 into debian sid
np :)
we debated it a while but 1.5.2 was making us kludge things a little too much
I find it mildly amusing that NEWS says that the forms developer now works better with 1.5.2 :)
yeah
I can completely understand :)
python2's much nicer
I'll upgrade this box this evening
I hope RH7.2 has python2
i'm not sure
otherwise I'll have to do it at home
yes it does
BUT
it's a python2*.rpm
iow it comes with the distro
but is not the distro's default python
thats fine
anyone have a win32 machine handy 
with gnuef dependencies installed?
preferably not win98
sorry
bummer
what you going about the key thing
master detail's a bitch to implement :)
always is :)
everything always ends up with the wrong key :)
the child result sets are pulling their foreign keys from the master result set during their post
they did that before didn't they?
let me guess: at that point the master doesn't have it's key yet on an insert?
only if the master is new as well
"if the master was an existing record, it worked fine"
"man , know pygresql updated it's fields"
and I'm supprized that is not part of DB API 2.0
I've honestly never seen anything like that until pygresql
although I wish all did :)
what does postgres do?
"and besides, you've got to handle completely broken db's like mysql that wouldn't know a foriegn key if a million fell on them"
Isomer: mysql basher eh? I think you'll fit in well here :)
heh
we drove away all the mysql lovers 
Isomer: we are talking foreign keys in principle; not necessarily DB-enforced foreign keys
rofl
"yeah, but you said something about postgres updating itself?"
the pygresql driver IIRC updated it's fields after a commit
so that a row commit would return the row
"that way any foriegn keys, fields updated by db triggers, etc were reflected in the data right away"
IIRC I used that feature in the old db drivers so that I could get OIDs
on newly inserted rows
cool
but we've grow to dislike pygresql a bit I'm afraid 
grow = grown
oh?
why is that?
it's buggy
and some are long standing bugs
such as?
"well, the real issue is there's a Python DB API we wanna use.. Pygresql itself has its own API, but wrote a wrapper around its API to support the standard"
we use it on undernet
and we *Really* give it a huge thrashing
the fetchOne on the DB API 2.0 does not work
IIRC pygresql works fine (using it's home-grown interface)
"a patch was submitted long ago but they won't, don't fix it"
but it's DB-API wrapper just plain sux
ahh ok
"yes, the custom API was what I used at first too"
our biggest problem with it is that you need to vacuum it regularly
and when you do it brings the entire thing to a halt
and when we've got realtime constraints
it's pretty harsh :)
i didn't think 7.1 did that anymore
It may not lock the entire database
or is it 7.2 cvs that has that fixed now
but it locks too much :)
"so, what other db's are there if you disqualify mysql and postgres is buggy?"
open source/free?
theres no point using something otherwise :P
"well, there's SAP-DB... never used it so can't comment"
"also, is it interbase that has a OSS version?"
interbase and sybase I thought were both OSS'd
is sybase OSS?
nope - but their first Linux version is free
ahh
they're abusing the word Free
and only supports 5 concurrent connections
free beer is bad
i dont thing postgresql is any buggier than others
free beer software that is :P
in fact i worked on a system where oracle crashed on shutdown every time
heheh
it was a known bug we were told to not worry about
oracle 6.x on VMS
it's the pygresql driver that gave us problems
sigh
xchat crashes on me once a day :(
:/
"since gnuef supports popy, pygresql, psycopg, pypgsql"
mdean: was that free as in beer?
i'm not too worried about pygresql issues anymore
btw - jcater
jcater: yes
sqlrelay driver was donated?
jcater: and it only supports 5 concurrent connections
"jamest: yeah, by me"
tho they don't mention that fact when you dl it
I was using it in house for testing a few months ago
and?
fell in love with it did you?
and realized yesterday that I hadn't put in CVS
it's ok
pwd
I was using it as a replacement for ODBC
believe it or not :)
cause at the time I couldn't find Oracle-python drivers for Windows
"but now, both DCOracle and cxOracle have win32-compatable python drivers"
BUT
"since it'd already been written, why not commit it :)"
:)
"actually, someone was asking about SQLRelay last week"
out of the blue
kinda odd
i'm all for it!
i hate seeing tools that only support 1 db 1 ui
that doesn't tourture the coders enough
:)
"well, I've decided to convert to debian"
can you install it via FTP?
?
i think so
but why?
cause I don't have a CD handy
think it faster than http?
ah
you can install lots o ways
you'll probably need the root and rescue floppy images
why the change?
I'm gonna get plex86 working
and debian helps in what way?
it's in sid now
no rpms?
"uh, no"
it's highly experimental
i wouldn't wish sid upon you
as is sid
is your laptop still debian?
"oh, yeah"
oh plz
I suppose I could test on that :)
sid is fine
as long as you read the debian new beofre upgrading
news
chillywilly: shut up
:D
what?
if there is any serious breakage you will know before you break your system just by going to #debian and msging apt and reading the news and the topic channel
"er, channle topic"
channel
wuss
I'd just die if I lost my data
do you have any idea how long it took to download all this pr)n
oops
XFS file system beotch
I guess with our new PATRIOT act
"now chillywilly, i know sid has whooped up on your machine at least once or twice"
I better not say that
I'm sure Time-Warner+FBI is monitoring every packet I send out now
"jamest: nope, my laptop forze before when I left it on all night but that is a temperature problem"
MS (RE)Active Government
it was really hot
"powering it off fscked my file system, but ext2 sux ass and I will never use it again"
sigh
only journaling for me
do we really need to support master/derail????
:)
derail?
hehe
rofl
"well, that's appropriate for now :)"
jcater: that was one of the driving factors for the db rewrite if you recall
better master/detail support
"oh, yeah"
so I vote we keep it :)
doh!
what was I smokin?
"dunno, but it sounds like some real good stuff!"
"it is better, right?"
right?
may
man
wxPython and win32
"jcater: well, yes"
it's better 
BUT
we want perfection
there's always a but
"or, in chillywilly's case, a butt"
oops
hey now!
right there man
we agreed not to talk about chillywilly like that when he's here
hehe
note to psu
---------
don't keep the thread on chillywilly's butt
---------
rofl
note to psu
keep all goat threads though ;)
one can never have enough gotat raping going on
"er, goat raping"
:P
you don't need threads
of goat raping
that's mad goat raping btw
you just need win32 and wxpython
jamest: speaking of threads
would it be too  much of an issue 
if debugging support in designer required an OS w/thread support??
jcater: designer is multi-threaded?
no
I was asking if it would be a problem if it was
"(in form-preview/debug mode only, though)"
I would hope not
we're upgrading undernet to pg7.2 now :)
does python threads work on win32?
is 7.2 ok
jcater which OS's would we lose
I dunno?
SCO Unix 4.2?
DOS
mac os
really?
wait
jcater: what would you parallelize?
doesn't wxwindows run under its own "thread"
older mac oses were not even multi-tasking
jamest: good point
newer ones probably aren't either :)
note that this would not break designer
only the realtime run/debugging
that is ok with me
mac os x uses freebsd on Mach
it has to have threads
mach is multi-threaded
it at least has cthreads
but I have a feeling since glibc is ont here you get pthreads too
can someone test new gnuef login code
it's in cvs
and passes the "it works for me" test
sure
hang on
sigh
what?
wife just told me her office uses MS Access
yes?
my wife works for the IRS
yes
so thats what the "if databasename==Taxes" code was in MS Access for...
lol
jcater: does it still work for you?
helloworld2 works
lemme test zipcodes
um
helloworld doesn't login :)
rofl
good point
heh
a good software engineer tests the contrary case anyway :)
"if I fail four times, I get"
DB000:     self._loginHandler.destroyLoginHandler()
DB000: AttributeError: 'UILoginHandler' instance has no attribute 'destroyLoginHandler'
"but if I don't make a mistake, it works fine :)"
arhg!
"DB000:   File ""/home/jason/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/GConnections.py"", line 205, in requestConnection"
The obvious solution there -- don't make mistakes!
"ok, i fix"
that was the line number :)
Isomer: that's what I said yesterday
"well, it was only a windows bug"
"if you wanna use Win98, you can't make mistakes"
:)
and they're used to lockups
DISCLAIMER: You will be fined $20 every time you make a mistake!
"jamest: sadly, there's a lot of truth in that :("
they're getting better tho
Isomer: I dunno
MS gets thrashed over their reliability or lack thereof
with MS's new licensing
so at least now they're trying
they may start charging for mistakes
which at least makes it amusing to watch
"actually, I'm surprised they don't charge you like they did Dimitry if you make mistakes"
"well, there is that too"
"jcater: ok, fixed"
"ah, much better"
so...hows master/detail?
:)
well
it's going
I think I have it fixed
pythin thinks otherwise
see python's fault!
"Maniac: no, derek's fault"
it was his form that found the bug
"yes, I agree"
we should shoot derek to prevent further occurances of bugs
and prevent people publishing security updates to prevent futher occurances of security holes too
uggh!
?
<sigh>
this is frustrating
jcater: slip a little Dave Matthews in the old cd player
relax
what's up?
I'm missing something somewhere
it's called a life
the values are getting set in the child recordsets
master/detail not detaling?
but not reflected in the insert statements
?
yip
they are being set in the recordset
that sums it up
but not in the insert?
(the '?)
(the '?' that is)
hmm
you're not returning a new recordset are you
yes keeping a handle to the old one
yes = yet
time to break out some GDebug.printMesg's
I'll show it
<sigh>
hmm
Isomer: problems?
not really
just bored & at work
Isomer: do like we do
keep an xterm on the side open w/gnue stuff in it :)
or several!
"hell, dedicate a virtual desktop or two to it"
bwahahahhaahaha
"I'd test it at work more, but see, um, i have a real OS on my desktop"
argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that good?
I've been beating my head against my Trinitron over this master/detail insert statement crap
just to finally realize it's another bug in another part of GDataObjects
GDataObjects isn't automatically "binding"
fields specified in masterfields or detailfields
you mean your 21 inch Trinitron?
yes
you shouldn't treat it like that
it's a rock solid monitor
I wouldn't worry
you'd better just send it to me until you can learn to treat it with respect
lol
my mom's gonna be upset with me
I was supposed to order one of these for her
but egghead went bankrupt before I got around to it
I haven't told her yet
:(
anyone recall how to redirect dos stderr to a file?
oh my
I don't think you can
you have to download a utility to do it
un fscking believable
where's masta???
I want to tell him just how much grief his form is!!
<rant target="mysql">
auto increments should be rather simple things to get right
and NULL and 0 are completely different concepts
"oh, yeah"
definitely
you'd think a relational database could figure that out
but NOOOOOOO
mysql is not a relational database
insert 0 into an auto increment field and what happens?
you get some other number *instead* of 0!
"but wait, theres more"
I like how it reuses deleted numbers
if you insert a negative number into that field
mdean: really?
it can nolonger create any more autonumbers
"jcater: it does, but I don't like it"
Isomer: hehe - nice feature
because the next one it generates will be MAXINT
mdean: neither would I
and the one after that will *also* be MAXINT
even if 0..MAXINT is *empty*
but wait! 
it gets better
you can insert a value in then UPDATE it to 0
but never insert
</end of rant>
mdean: mysql *thinks* it's a relational db
how about it's handling of the timestamp data type?
even though it wouldn't know relational if it was married to it
"insert a null into it, it populates with the current date/time"
"if you have multiple timestamps in a table and do not specify them in an insert/update query, guess what it does?"
HALLELUAH!!!!
populates the *first* timestamp with current date/time
and leaves the rest alone
finally got the damn thing working!!!
mdean: it does that with DATETIME's too
very very annoying
"when I say NULL, I mean *NULL* dammit!"
I find autonumbers even more entertaining
since it appears to confuse NULL with 0
which really is a fundamental problem 
knows whats even worse than that?
yes
sigh
jamest: the fact that they documents these as features?
jamest: are my TriggerExtensions no longer implemented in trigger namespaces?
  people actually build business apps with mysql and can't figure out why some of us have issues with that
"jcater: no, they were causing a namespace collision of some sort"
jamest: I'm employeed to do that
but we've convinced them to migrate to postgres
"ah, ok"
I think I documented it in the cvs log
"Isomer: you poor, poor person"
I loath it too
I tend to do "other things"
"hey, it's OK that you have to lock the entire table for writing"
pg has a lot of similarities to Erkle
mdean: they're fine grained enough to do entire table locks?
Isomer: what?  you need more?
s/this day/these days/
"actually, a co worker pointed me to http://www.innodb.com/ today"
jcater: :)
noone would require anything more fine grained than locking the entire machine
so you get it all fixed up jcater?
yes and no
yes master/detail works right
however?
"but no it doesn't auto-repopulate the recordset, so derek's form isn't quite working right :)"
(entering data is broken :)
"bah, who would want to enter data?"
rofl
Isomer: where you working btw?
Business Systems Developments
jamest: do you know if the pre-commit triggers are actually getting called correctly?
Isomer: and more importantly is your name Andrew?
Nope
roflmao
BSD!
jcater: not a clue
sigh
making me think
Isomer: i think 75% of the NZr's I know are named Andr(u|ew)
ahh
jcater: is this the form w/ all the buttons?
yes
IIRC he wrote this while at Axis
just to make life interesting
and it was a pita then too
"jamest: it actually works, except that he's using an autoincrement field"
jcater: that's broken!
argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"er, um"
<sigh>
don't be so melodramatic
although you tend to bash your knees occasionly
lol
jcater: anything I can do to help
valium?
prozac?
15 minutes for this python rpm
I dunno
sigh
"as I, er, um, promised a windows user they'd have their form tomorrow"
what d'ya got
um
what do they need?
i didn't write the form so I don't know
it to work?
but we use autoincrements alot
so I imagine i'll get bit
do you use it for foreign keys?
typically
<sigh>
(that's a double-sigh)
i don't know on this specific form
as my assistant wrote it
lemme see if I can repopulate the records fairly easily
but I do know my school contact database uses autoincrements alot
"dude, I swore I tested this after SF"
SF?
and didn't have an issue
maybe I'm on crack
you have something to test against?
San Fransisco
ah
do you guys have a test suite to do automated testing?
rofl
Isomer: it's called "Derek"
"Isomer: yeah, it's called derek"
rofl
x2
*sigh*
damn thing works too well
"I calculated everything and I am $60,000 in debt woohoo!"
chillywilly: dang boy
jcater: I'll modify the states.gfd demo real quick
chillywilly: college tuition?
those 1-900 numbers really sneak up on you don't they?
yep + credit cards and other misc. loans
rofl
hmm
"$60,000"
that or he has a secret SAP addiction
plus I owe my mom lots of money
thats nasty
how much debt you got jc?
except my mortgage
"but it took 4 long, long years"
of sack lunches
yea
heheh
"but, haven't used one of those for 2 1/2 years now"
gack
how debt did you have then?
let me get demo from work
"chillywilly: about 1/3 of what you had... but I was able to pay for college as I went, so no student loans"
"mine was pure, unadulterated (no excuse) debt"
state college?
yes
bah
that's cheap
:P
I went to a private college one year
"plus, his being an AI help, he was able to sell spare cycles to SETI users "
it was really great
but I couldn't afford it
so transferred to state
i hated private school
had full ride there too
felt like high school all over again
well I think someone should've kicked me in the head when I was thinking about MSOE
MSOE?
Milwaukee School of Engineering
not M$
damnit
;P
http://www.msoe.edu
jcater: hey!
i think I dodged the bullet
howdy hey
looking for an example
how so?
Must Spend Outragously and Extravagently? 
something like that
I don;t even have th engineering job to show for it
yay!
I'm not finding any entry screens that require the key in a detail
a total an utter waste of my time
5 minutes left on python2
but did you enjoy it?
jamest: how are your details working then?
they all reference data entered on other screens
so I may autogenerate a id for a contact
so they are lookup/maintain only; not creation
right
the creation forms are not master/detail
yay
hmm
your approach probably doesn't have the limitations that mine did
when I wrote something similar
it was all revolving around built up SQL statements
Isomer: we don't even require an SQL backend :)
yeah
well I had problems when you tried to do updates on multiple tables
particularly if you were updating a foreign key
evening all ;)
how goes the study?
"750,00 lines of code for evolution"
like crap
"er, 750,000"
not many
GNUe gone over 10M yet? ;)
"ajmitch: well, that's about how many tylenol's we've gone thru"
hehe
heh
at work we can put materials down with jobs
"so we've got it configured to say how much coffee, water, beer, sanity, pizza the job required"
heheh
our clients got confused when we billed them for 10% sanity
hehe
i like it ;)
"Isomer: so you're out working now, and hopefully with GNUe?"
I'm at work trying to get python2 installed so I can get GNUe working
so I can give the boss a resonably convincing demo
"hehe, fun"
so I can convince him to try and pay me to work on it during work hours :)
hehe
Isomer: where do you work?
yikes lots of back log to read
ello masta
"i'll hold his legs, jcater you get the ants"
"derek: yeah, i just spent a few min reading thru what;s happened in the last few hours ;)"
hello
chillywilly: Business Systems Developments (obscurely enough a company that does Business Apps under Linux)
jamest: i didnt know you were so kinky
plz shoot me so i can get out of debt with the life insurance money ;)
heh
gotta love cygwin
chillywilly: two words
junk bonds
j/k
it's happily installing cvs when I requested bash
that was nice of her
I am worht more dead anyway
hehe

this is going to take a while
gah
that's why I hate rpm
gimmy apt anyday
fucking grab those damn packages for me!!!
apt-get install gnue
and we'd be done by now
apt-get install geas
works
pity there's no gnue virtual package
"that has dependendics on gnue-forms, gnue-geas, etc"
who want to be the official packager? ;)
jbailey is
silly
;)
damn
skimmed the log now its already full again 
he's our official debian bitch
sigh no chance in catching up tonight
he is? where are packages? me wants packages in sid now!
Isomer: do yourself a favor
derek: the first part of it was us bitching at you and your form
compile python from source
it gets rid of redhat stupid ass dependencies
hmm
now thats a plan
the 2nd part was us bitching just about you
hehe
believe me im on rh6.2 on my laptop
and it has made my life SOOOOOOOOOO much easier going to source for things
all of gnue dependencies are source for me and i didnt have to upgrade 'anything but the dependencies'
I should upgrade this poor box to 7.2 anyway
"i.e. i just got python, wx, etc etc"
yeah install debian :)
just go debian :)
can't
we tried that
it makes things real ugly
oh?
btw: jcater i see my work is done and i have given you sufficent hell in a single bug report
we've got shared /home 
debian != ugly
so you end up with things not working on some machines
ugh
derek: three independent bugs from that one bug report!!!!
derek: isn't this the form from hell you tourtured me with when you wre in CA?
rofl
jamest: me torture forms developers?
if so you managed it get a ton of milage out of it
unheard of. pure blasephmy
derek: as opposed to co-dependent bugs :)
jamest: yes same form :)
it really is a ball buster
sounds useful then ;)
we should automate it's testing cycle
:)
derek: it works now
except for one small detail
"(i.e., you can't create new people :)"
reproduction is overrated
but you can create all the new addresses for the existing people that you want
"actually, that's not entirely true"
"you can create a new person, "
you just can't associate an address with them until a later session
still working on that though
later session?
or until after they've been committed?
the latter
kinda sorta
rofl
you'd have to commit
requery 
then add
:)
if I understand correctly
btw: how you guys like the nice
ditch gnue come work on compiere post to the list
?
i have no problem with people doing this but doing it in mass is some what tacky
"derek: heh, yeah"
just read that 30sec ago
generally if i see someone post a message and someonthing liek that to say i email them personally off list
but oh well
??
question is do i respond in whole or in part?
or ignore
hmm
depoends
are the paying?
i havent installed compiere so i cant speak too much to it
he's basically expecting gnue developers to drop all gnue coding & join compoere
:)
but i can say mpl is not best of licenses for MOST developers
that having to have oracle knocks out most of the rest
and fact its all java kills another whole group
yep
you have to have oracle?
i assume its rather hard coded stuff with tables to enter variable information (which i think is the OLD way of doing things)
question is do we respond at all or not
im firm believer of the best will crawl to the top
i think maybe respond
and that there is room for more than one ERP
forced unsub? 
re: Kator
"Oh Yeah!  Well, we'll take our python and go home!"
heh
"shrug, multiple competing products are a good idea"
look at irc servers :)
jamest: rofl
Isomer: we'd never force unsub
especially since I lost the list admin password :)
"jamest: yeah, I was only kidding "
rofl!
Isomer: you have some experience with irc servers... ;)
ajmitch: speak of what you're knowledgable:)
;)
you still maintainer?
currently yes
ok
we're working on 2.10.11
currently it's having fun desyncing the network
cool
sounds like lotsa fun ;)
i guess it has to be able to handle high irc loads
I wonder what our peak load of a server is
"with script kiddies flooding, probably quite high ;)"
well
"we've had 12,000 clients on one server"
probably more
-Paris.Fr.Eu.Undernet.Org- Highest connection count: 14948 (14947 clients)
hmm
quite a few
15k
most OS's really don't like that many open tcp connections
what do you run it on?
usually FreeBSD's
"not GNU/Hurd, i bet ;)"
although we've got them ranging from solaris through linux to various BSD's
since it still needs that pfinet rewrite ;)
yah
been looking at zebra
which says it wants to be the routing table translator
ok
and created ourselves a mini internet
useful
so we've been teaching ourselves dynamic routing :)
do you have a masquareded network?
"yep, all of two computers at the moment"
heh
getting another one (p133) on saturday
what we do is run software on the gateway that connects to everyone elses gateway machine
via a VPN
then run a dynamic routing protocol over it
"so once i got another monitor or two, i'll have a hurd box to play on ;)"
cool
I should turn one our boxen at home to hurd
yeah
"i've got to get install cds, too slow downloading it all"
we've got like 12 machines at the flat
I don't think the flatmates will notice another one
heh
how many flatmates?
for a total of 4
"from sunday i'll be flatting, there'll only be 2 of us until february"
we'll only have about 5 machines
we started with like 3
and ran out of ports on the 8 port switch
"yeah, i'm starting with 3 as well :)"
and I'm worried that we're going to fill up the 8 port hub
"you're in hamilton, right?"
yep
what's your power bill like there? :)
dunno
I should check
would be reasonably high with 12 machines
the dec alpha was chewing power like there was no tomorrow :)
t'was fun to play with
hmm
"psu will have fun summarising this thread, entirely off-topic ;)"
:)
he's going to have a fun day today :)
hehe
i should see if i can get my boss interested in GNUe ;)
would be interesting
give me a chance to play with it :)
yeah
:)
sorta what you're trying to do?
yeah
"well, theres nothing better than being paid to hack on OSS :)"
sure... being paid to do absolutely nothing :)
doing absolutely nothing can be boring
coding's more fun
yeah
poop did my connectino die?
dunno
derek: nice response on the mailing list :)
freaking java weenies
that's what both those projects are
and that one is only semi-free
if you can call it that
semifree?
you have to use prop. tools
"good response, derek :)"
oracle... ugh
hmm
not many people happen to have oracle lying about
postgres is more common
who wants to haveit lygin about anyway?
doesn't java have jODBC or something?
"One main differentiation is that complex software like ERP requires additional licenses. For Compiere the following licenses are required:
    * Database (Oracle 8i)
    * Reporting (InetSoft)
    * Rule Engine (ILOG)
"
we are defintely not Java fans
gah
that is haf assed
they don't even deserve to use the term Open Source
;P
"phpnuke has multiple db support now, so it says"
they use the term free software actually
much less Free Software
Mr_You: really?
kewl
http://phpnuke.org/downloads.php
cause it has been a mysql whore for a while now
"you don't like mysql, i take it"
just what is so bad about it? ;)
ajmitch: I am not alone
no transaction support
no sub selects
not very SQL compliant
"admin tools suck too, imho"
ajmitch: scroll back
chillywilly: phpmyadmin imho is very very nice
Isomer: how far?
there's also a webmin module for SquidGuard ;-)
Isomer: there is phppgadmin
in case anyone uses that.. web interface to http blocker
"ajmitch: yeah there is, however phpmyadmin has a certain ""polish"" to it IMHO :)"
mysql is a toy db
just admit it
"on the other hand, it's a nice admin tool to a horrible program :)"
toy would be overrating it?
ajmitch: grab back for "<rant "
there's mysql-navigator ;)
s/grab/grep/
it is an alternate file system interface
:D
mysql - the db for ppl who like to make using files fun!
heh
mysql is a SQL file system ;-)
Isomer: it's a good thing you used the <rant> tag ;)
Mr_You: ;)
"cool, phppgadmin works fine here ;)"
there is phppgadmin also
same here
"greatbridge seemed to support it, but I dunno now.."
no!
eyes must be on monitor at all times mdean-[restingEyes]
who told you could stop coding?
chillywilly: are you coding at the moment?
l8r
trying anyway
I got a nice race condition
hehe
and  adeadlock too
but I know why
fix it then
I am
damnit
get back to coding ajmitch!
everyone
get to coding now!!!
or else...
or else...?
doesn't matter what it is
what you gonna do?
just write the code
heh
swim over here & beat up us kiwis?
you betcha
I am about to whoop you
hmm
hah
anyway...
code...
hmm
in the .tgz version of gnue-forms
is there supposed to be stuff under "Edit"?
you mean gnue-designer
?
I wonder if it is just appending the string to the freaking string stream
doh
gah!!!
I am stupid
yeah
sorry
Error processing <form> tag [I do not recognize the "width" attribute
hmm
ack
I suspect I've got a real old version of designer :)
um
could be ;)
yeah :)
and it doesn't like new forms :)
I notice we still have a python21 setting in our gnue.conf :)
whoops
:)
we probably should make the pointsize 12 instead of 14
as this is large :)
:)
i'm just happy it's working
yes
as am I 
as you must be looking at a form
i wonder
good ol' helloworld2.gfd
"ok, it does honor gnue.cond"
conf
:)
cool
fwiw: wxpython 2.3.2b6 looks better under windows than 2.3.1
hmm
is this gfclient.exe 2.3.1 or 2.3.2b6?
2.3.1
and the toolbar is corrupted
it's an old bug
that 2.3.2 seems to fix
"oh yeah,"
all my wxPythons are hybrid
so they do debug dumps
on exit
:)
and we've built this thing as a console app
thus the dos box in the background
jamest: did you only install the pypgsql and mysql-python drivers?
yip
i tried the others
that I could find
but the interbase one didn't import for some reason
and the oracle was a no go
rock!
my extras thingy works
good
not that I had any doubts :)
:)
so we're pretty much down to doc updates now right?
best I can tell
unless masta finds problems
i vote we not let him look
"IOW, make ChanServ kick him off for the next 2 days"
or gnuebot
or bigbrother
:)
!jcater_
I'm headed to bed
i need sleep
nite all
see you tomorrow
hi all
good day
yo
'sup?
nuttin much
at work?
yip
early start
yo
"yes, somebody is here"
'sup
howdy
hi all
hi
howdy
ok we have paid gnue developer full time now officially
we REALLY need dcl
especially if we get college interns
so i come to you guys and ask where do you want me to sic the pit bull?
derek: there's one problem
that assumes we're organized
well give me an account somewhere
but i will set up dcl and get it going
i will gladly manage the interns and the new employee :)
bbs must leave arggggggg
"work is dreadful, work is fun, joy joy joy"
hey dneighbo
dneighbo: doesn't work
I've been telling myself that for years
it's still not fun
"hey, speak for yourself ;)"
i had fun when i wrote free software full time
babysitting and interfacing to prop software is just dreadful most of the time :(
hey groovy new news at gnuenterprise.org
jcLunch when you get back check for correctness
dneighbo: looks great
just wanted to make sure not telling too many lies
i really liked the infoworld article
"yes, that is a good article"
sigh
we need t-shirts
yes we do
we need a few things
lol
maybe we can discuss today or tonight
can I slap my people around???
jcater: only if you use 'official gnue licensed' trout
jamest did you get around to posting windows test builds?
dneighbo: just sent you that email
gfclient at www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release
designer isn't done yet
jamest: you around?
sort of
dneighbo sez you're an nfs mount guru
"um, ok"
could you spare some hints?
trying 2 different things:
1. mount the fs /home/~ dir to newworkstation /home/~
2. mount fs /usr/ports/distfiles to workstation/ports/distfiles
so the ports collection only has to download once..
i think my /etc/export line is foobar
it reads /home /usr/ports/distfiles/ -alldirs -maproot=0 172.16.0.109
?
what OS
fbsd
i'm getting permission denied
adn there is not /etc/exportfs 
"um, in fbsd it's /etc/exports"
adn?
and??
"hmmm. well, back to the man pages.."
ToyMan he is getting old..... probably either stilling trying to remember what he was going to say :)
cleaning his dentures ;)
sorry
no problemo
"i have not done fbsd exports in a long, long, um long time"
IIRC after you setup the exports file
you have to run shareall 
IIRC
"oh well, it's the learning curve thing"
IIRC? <- what's this?
"havn't seen a ref to shareall, maybe things have changed a bit"
If I Recall Correctly
hmmm
ahhh.  always wondered what that one meant
could you try the command
exports
to see if it says something?
 Command not found.
export<tab>
/etc/exports is a file where you set up your exports
nada
and you don't have anything firewalled?
it's a local mount
inter network..
not intra
or did i get the prefixes backwords?
"heh, nfs mount over a 28.8 modem..."
that would be painful
kinda like windoze file sharing ;)
:)
and portmap is running?
yep
I'm pretty sure it's my exports file..
I had just /home/stuq and it worked
mount -w bucky:/home/stuq /mnt <- no prob
but when I add additional mount points in /etc/exports
it coughs
"well, gotta go, thanks for trying"
hmmm we got an HR proposal today... very interesting
hi...
somebody told me you need windows testers... oh dear why did I try this ;)
jamest: you are here?
:)
hi
madlocke: did you send those files?
not yet... have to change some things... to this later... first some more important things...
I tried to work with windows as I already said
using WinCVS to checkout...
cvs converts everything from lf to cr+lf
ok so far... but not for image files... 
"quick grab him, bolt him to the chair... muhahahhaa"
these files are not marked binary in cvs...
madlocke i think we need to make the cvs server do this
i.e. extension types of .... automatically check them in as binary
if we are not already 
madlocke: we need windows testers of the files in www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release :)
dneighbo: would be great to handle this automatically. manually it works by adding with -kb option
madlocke is there anyway you can tar/gz your current work with webware and email to jamest or info@gnue.org
the designer one is known broken btw
even if its not complete or is getting more done to it?
it would make the natives here much less restless. :)
jamest: I have to talk about gfd files with you first...
jamest: one bad example for a gfd file is ./samples/location/zipcode_maint.gfd
jamest: can you open this so it is easier talking about it...?
"rofl, you want a really bad example look for ./samples/track/forms/contact_manager.gfd"
mornin' all!
dneighbo: not bad because it is big... another prob...
"madlocke: talk away, but I'm kinda busy"
jamest: you see maybe that there are 3 labels and after this the list of entries...
so responce may be a bit slow
hey madlocke
"jamest: the only relation between labels and entries is position on screen in x,y coordinates... you understand the prob?"
hi ajmitch
"info cvs, it talks about binary files"
there was talk of binding a label to an entry
madlocke: that is correct
dneighbo: it is already easier if the label tag is near the entry tag...
or basically autocreating the lable based off a property of entry
"because if I just ignore any positions and read from top to bottom, the relation is still there (if order is correc)"
yes
where can I find "mx" ?
jamest: can you install webware and then I send the files and do installation together with you? maybe it is easier because probably if have to write less text ;)
some words about installtion on windows system...
yes after some hours I had my first form on the screen ;)
installing postgres drivers eh Isomer :)
dneighbo: yeah :/
"madlocke: I'll have to install webware at home, i'll try and get done tonight or tomorrow"
look in the README or INSTALL file
it has the url there
madlocke if you can be here in like 3 hours or so
madlocke: : the files in pre-release are setup.exe's
i will do the webware install with you
it takes minutes
and fully document
so we can get documented for others
"no python, drivers, etc needed"
we should get hte webware version installed on ash as well :)
"dneighbo: if I can still sit on my chair in 3 hours, then yes... ;) at the moment it is 23:00 here ;)"
Isomer: http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html
jamest: id did a cvs co and then used the install scripts...
jamest: ok maybe not the right way for good install ;)
webware is running on my box here...
jamest: but... in setup.py you are changing/creating gfclient file
jamest: in this file there are some pathes... but there are other pathes in gnue.conf
jamest: these I had to change manually... why?
jamest: another question: why installing everything in python path?
jamest: why not something like ".\program files\gnue" and add the according pathes to PYTHON_PATH at startup
"jamest: I think finding modules, etc is a more general problem in gnue not only for gnuef, so maybe there can be a solution in gnue-common"
madlocke: try the setup.exe's
they address most of what you speak of
everything is now in Program Files\gnue
the old setup was our first attempt just to prove she'd run
ok
so the setup will change later in cvs too?
because maybe someone tries the same ?
nope
cvs on win32 is a developers install
then in each packages doc/installer
are instructions/files for building the exe's which are installed for a user properly
great this helps I think
the plus side of this is the setup.exe's _should_ be networkable
where as python itself doesn't support network installs
:)
:)
how are the exes created? with py2exe?
nope
it doesn't support PyXML so py2exe files
fails
McMillian Installer and Inno
it's all in the README
fwiw: we just got this up last night
ok... like all the time... rftm.. understand... :) it's just new for me that there is any doc ;)
lol
we promise it won't happen again
"bad coder, no donut"
you hear that jason NO DONUT
what did jcater do now?
documentation
aaaah!
how dare you do such a vile and evil thing'
yeah jcater!  how could you document the windows setup.exe stuff!  It's all your doing! 
actually he wrote db driver docs
just your installer docs reminded me of his punishment
btw: masta is testing windows installer so running is probably better than sneaking at this point
self preservation is a good thing(tm)
i cant tell if it worked
installed yes
but if i click on icon it opens dos shell flashes somethign and closes dos shell
same from menu
that's cause you don't have a filename
double click on a .gfd file
or alter properties to add a gfd file after the exe
i was hoping someone <cough>derek<cough>
would do up a little intro form 
"saying welcome, here are a few features (no db links)"
that we could put on that icon
i can do that
BUT one thing where did it install the samples?
i dont see them under the tree
it doesn't yet
"i can add them, just a sec"
if you add them then i will verify it works
and then whip up a simple little form or rather SET of forms :)
one form that has a list of different things
then when you click on the button it opens that sample
like the wxWindows sampler does
"dneighbo: I think he meant something that could be finished in, say, the next 5 minutes :)"
i think that only takes 5 minutes
if designer was working on windows :)
dneighbo: new designer uploading now that works
:)
"or, :)p"
jcater: get ready to time him
someone did already some work an a geometry engine?
an a = on a
"yes, but we never saw/got the code"
who did it?
one of the reasons we got nervous when you left 
:)
understand...
dneighbo: new .exe's in that pre-release dir
madlocke: perlpoet iirc
hm... never saw him....
jamest: I'm thinking we should rename the <Right Click>|edit feature to <Right Click>|Open in Designer
ok
with me
as for adding the samples
I can do that
however
we should get a "real" group of samples first
as right now we have a mess :)
ok
how are the two related?
huh?
two what?
sorry
missed the 
<jamest> as for adding the samples
:)
and while I'm complaining about things
you guys really should catch the "no such provider" exception
and throw a dialog box at the screen
Isomer: you getting a DB0000 dump
or just a nice format text mesage
anyone try the -a.exe's yet?
(other than jcater)
i wanna know if the icons in designer look pink
"DB000:   File ""/usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/GConnections.py"", line 227, in _load_dbdriver"
"DB000:     raise GDataObjects.ProviderNotSupportedError, \"
DB000: gnue.common.GDataObjects.ProviderNotSupportedError: No database driver found for provider type 'pypgsql'
hmm
I tried installing them
but ran out of space
and got a "setup.exe is corrupt" error 
but that was probably due to running out of space on the d/
l
unfortunately some urgent work has arrived here today
so I'm not going to be experimenting as much
ok
thanks for the error report
ok downloading now
DB000: Traceback (most recent call last):

rm

DB000: AttributeError: 'None' object has no attribute 'setLoginHandler'
this is when no connections.conf exists... better msg would be good here too
I also mentioned last night that if I click "next" again in the wizard it says "no such attribute pypgsql" or something similar
madlocke!
he lives!
Isomer: I fixed the second problem in CVS
chilly: some parts still live... yes ;)
"but as for the first one, we do need better error handling in that part"
excellent :)
if you want to be really nice
you can put a "? Help" button on the dialog
madlocke: you got some code for those web forms? ;)
that sends you  to www.gnuenterprise.org/errors/no.such.provider.html
"which has a FAQ about that error and what might cause it, possible solutions, etc :)"
"chilly: yep... have to change some things.. but have some things yes... talked already a bit about it with jamest and dneighbo, but did not send code yet..."
maybe I am too stupid but where are thos setup*.exes ?
madlocke: ok
http://www.gnuenteprise.org/~jamest/
http://www.gnuenteprise.org/~jamest/pre-release/
actually
thx...
oh dear... I want my faster connection... :( bad phone company...
hope tomorrow I'll get it...
hell yes designer windows install works and it kicks SERIOUS ASS
looks better on windows :)
cept for the pink icon back grounds :)
rofl
"good, I'm not mental"
where did you put the samples?
rofl
im too lame to find them
jcater: that's open to debate
argh!
i don't get it
i do have an old form on here
I fixed the pink icons 
i thin there is a python issue
as it says cant find form 'c:\\somepath\\otherpath\\form.gfd
instead of c:\form\path\form.gfd
when calling it do you have to do c:/form/path/form.gfd
or
c:\\form\\path\\form.gfd
also where are samples :)
no samples in setup.exe yet
i have to run
make gripe list and jump me when I return :)
dneighbo: from the command prompt?
'cause this works for me
C:\Program Files\gnue\forms>gfclient p:\it\gnue\cvs\gnue\gnuef\samples\helloworld2.gfd
ok massive problems :)
yes from command prompt
but getting massive errors on double clicking
http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/
error1.bmp
error2.bmp
form.bmp
will show errors
i need to run will be back in an hour or so
and explain more fully though i wont have this system to recreate until tomorrow :)
sigh
are those large files?
edit your c:\program files\gnue\etc\gnue.conf and change prefix from c:\python21 to c:\program files\gnue (jamest forgot to do that before making the EXE's)
or have you already done that?
no i havent done that 
and probably explains some of the problems :)
yes
that bit me too
I yelled at him enough for the both of us
:)
yes that fixed the problem :)
btw: shouldnt that be DYNAMIC
as you can choose WHERE to install iirc
so hardcoding the gnue.conf could cause issues if someone picks a custom install location
or so it would seem
well
we were discussing that
or just doing baby steps for now :)
:)
ok right off bat i can think of a few things
one is installing the desktop icon is pointless
"for gfclient, you mean?"
i think it should install it but have the default sample form pointed too
so if someone clicks it they get a formt
that says edit this to point to form of your choice :)
or somethign
OR
well
we need to make it so that if you run gfclient
and do not pass it a form file name
that is what jamest wanted that intro form for
it opens a dialog asking you to choose a form with a file chooser
this would be helpful i think
anyhow
even on linux
but making these suckers double clickable is pretty sweet and kills most of that need :)
so maybe scratch that idea
anyhow must run will look at making an 'intro' form whne i get home
what unit's are coordinates in?
characters
ahh
hmm
cute
argh!!
damn
hehe
you scared him away
notjamest: I have stuff to commit before you get involved
"ah, it's notjamest this time :)"
did i break something?
no
but I added "components"
so you can install "Sample Form Definitions"
or "Sample Configuration Files"
cool
lemme commit
inno rocks
then it's my turn to run home
'course it's written in delphi so it's got to be good
rofl
don't let derek know
ok 
committed
"the Sample Forms doesn't quite do what I want it to... it doesn't include a directory structure, only the helloworld2.gfd and contact.gfd samples :("
bbiab
did derek leave?
yo jbailey
hi
hallo
jamest: you alive?
yip
I downloaded the setup.exe
and installed it
would you like to see the error I get when I fire up gfclient.exe?
you bet
DB000: Traceback (most recent call last):
"DB000:   File ""<string>"", line 54, in ?"
"DB000:   File ""c:\python21\gnue\forms\gfclient.py"", line 112, in run"
"DB000:   File ""c:\python21\gnue\forms\gfclient.py"", line 137, in runForm"
DB000: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\python21/forms/gfclien
t.exe.gfd'
I have ActivePython installed
think that's screwin' me up?
stbain: you need to edit c:\program files\gnue\etc\gnue.conf and change prefix=c:\python21 to c:\program files\gnue
that was a small tafu on our part
no problemo
Why do I always think of that as the girlfriend client? =)
rofl
that'd explain the crashing :)
nope
it's the gnue.conf error jcater spoke of
argh!
wait
[forms]
prefix=C:\program files\gnue
FormDir =%(prefix)s/forms
there
that should do it?
you're running it from the icon right?
right
that icon won't work :)
lol
ok
from the command line?
find a .gfd file and double click on it
ahhh
ok
or add a gfd file to the end of the exe line in the icon's properties
as gnuef will not run unless given a file
ok
hrmmm.... doesn't look like any gfd files shipped in the setup.exe
nope
oversight on my part
jcater! you're back
this is why it's a "pre" release :)
oh yeah
jamest: you just now notice that?
"it just sunk in, I'm doing homework"
:)
i have no windows machine
so it'll be a while before I can do anything w/ install
sigh
wife has need for it
I can play here at home
as I have my laptop hooked up
dude.. what time is it?
um
6:30
CST
thanks
jamest: on that math homework
"if it comes up, 2+2 = 4"
today's mysql rant
mysqldump doesn't generate sql that mysql will read
jcater: dude! thanks! I've been hammering on that one for about an hour
jcater: but I need a proof
lol
did you see the proof I posted about women == evil?
no
lets have it dude
http://www.funkypages.com/girls_evil
oh and more mysql joy
you can create tables with "-"'s in them (somehow)
but you can't drop them
hmm
found it
``'s
brb
"yes, it's me"
yea
ack
take it back
I don't like it
hey retacj
damn
try that again
I dare you
plz sir may I have some more
I am working on something always
not always GNUe though
not for a long while
actually
:(
too busy work'n on the hurd eh?
GSim
gsim yes
I haven't done Hurd hacking in eons
I leave that tot he real hackers
;)
Gsim?
dude
my friggin thread-safe singleton method is fscking me up
gah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Isomer: a simulation library I am writing
ah
what are you simulating?
it is a generic library for discrete event simulation
you can simulate all sorts of things
just gotta code it
I saw a simuation of CSMA/CD
simulation
Simulation *
Simulation::Instance ()
{
  // First check
  if (instance == NULL)
    {
      // Ensure serialization
      lock.EnterMutex ();
      
      // Double check
      if (instance == NULL)
	instance = new Simulation;
    }
  lock.LeaveMutex ();
  return instance;
}
that should be thread safe right ;)
well looks like I just need more debugging statements until I can figure out where it is hanging/deadlocked
:(
is it me
or are you leaving the mutex more often than your entering it?
it is only once
calling leave twice doesn't hurt
but it is only called once
I got that methods from C++ journal
method
or some crap
accept I am using the Mutex class in GNU Common C++
GSim will be GNU Sim soon I hope
maybe...
maybe?
you doubt me?>
yes
zup j's
getting ready to leave
jamest did you read backlog and get my messages?
no
i think jcater beat you enough on the hardcoded gnue.conf entry
the other one was making the desktop icon and other link call a sample form
derek: you gnue'ing?
so people dont click and go damn its broke
jamest either gnue'ing or simcity'ing
:)
ajmitch: ?
derek: I mentioned that one w/ hopes you'd make the intro form
well i have a few hcs hacks to apply first and then i was going to gnue
we need to decide what we still need for release
but 3 new dvd's came today so i might get called into movie action :)
i'm thinking a simple users guide would be nice
i will look at a form and we should include the tech ref
and we need to make a 'manual' for designer
that has 'pictures'
etc
dang
i will look into some of this end of week
sigh
for now our 0.1.0 can live w/o it
yay!
just including techref will be enough
good
imho
as unlike the source we can readily post docs to website and have people grab
we have the installer and a URL link to the docs
in the startup menu
and not have them risk damaging too much :)
then they are always up to date :)
that would work :)
i have to run to store will be back soon
l8r
bbathm 
bbathm?
be back after the movie (oops bbatm)
wb
did you kick some butt?
um
that 12 yr old didn't stand a chance!
j/k
tonight was pressure point class
where we learn to hurt people with less effort :)
lol
some people can do it via IRC
is that what you're practicing on us?
you bet
lyx
I still can't get lyx working
apt-get install lyx
the sgmltools.org site has been down for me
what should be in a users guide?
jcater: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sgmltools-lite/
jcater: http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-sgml.html?dwzone=linux#resources
sigh
now I have no excuse
user == end luser or user == end developer?
user = end user
designer would have different guide 
"well, an introduction of what gnuef is and how it fits in to the GNUe architecture"
what a gfd is and how designer can be used to create it
(one paragraph each :)
"Then a summary of a basic user session? like describing what committing, inserting record, creating record, etc do"
I really dunno
ok
thanks
yay
we have samples
cool
cool
sigh
"after all that, I just found the ""recursesubdirs"" flag"
jcater: I'm sorry man
I looked and looked and looked
i read about that yesterday and forgot all about it
then when I finally had a working solution
it was the first thing that popped up in help when researching the next problem
:(
jcater: you get lyx up yet?
finishing the tests of windows inno install
just committed my stuff
cool
you got a new version up
?
not anything beyond
gfclient-0.1.0-a
er
gfclient-pre-0.1.0-a
ah ok
sigh
jade won't build
at least it's consistant
thanks
heh
jcater: there is also openjade
a jade replacement that i think is seeing more activity
"'course, if I'd stuck with my FreeBSD install, I coulda done a ports install by now :)"
um
it's all good
any luck?
"well, I have openjade and sgmltools-lite installed"
but still no docbook support in lyx
you have to edit->reconfigure
_if_ you have the docbook stylesheets properly installed
then she should pick them up and you're set
sigh
hmm
gnue uses corba?
at the moment
geas does
does it also use the gnome corba stuff?
"ie, does this integrate well with gnome?"
it uses ORBit
no
dunno what you mean about integrating with gnome :)
there will be no depedencies on a desktop
as some of us have headless servers
"and eventually no dependencies on CORBA, too"
is gnome only a desktop?
I had the sneaking suspicion that gnome was a framework
which people had used for a desktop
it's sorta a desktop framework :)
i think it had grand ideas at the start
that'd be my analysis: it's a desktop framework :)
the whole Network Object Model gNOMe
but i don't think that's what she became
I don't have a problem working well w/ gnome but gnue will not require gnome
hmm
'k
"that'd be cool if there was a Bonobo adapter for gaes, embed gnue objects into your spreadsheet"
yeah!
nickr: you volunteering? ;)
nickr: that'll be possible with our GComm layer
ajmitch: talk to me in 3 months when I'm done with my first gnue projcet :)
someone'll just have to write an adapter (which won't be difficult)
or what about a bonobo forms client?
yea
that'd be especially useful
"ajmitch: now, that could be funky"
"bleh, I'm really disillusioned about existing programming languages"
hahaha on the gnome comments
jamest i have lots of ideas for ENDUSER manual
and besides
and it includes lots of pictures (Seriously)
you guys seem to be collecting dependancies at the moment :)
derek: I've started the manual
enduser manual?
hmm
and it includes pictures :)
and it's in <gasp!> lyx
yes
what do end users see?
derek: I'm no longer alone!
".html, .dvi, .ps, .pdf"
I guess :)
jcater has entered my docbook hell
im sorry
sigh
the more i use lyx i think its evil
as I made the lyx docs in docbook format
i prefer raw docbook xml
i like lyx concept
and guess what
but xforms dependency and HAVING to have lyx to do transformations licks bag
the fucking (it's too personal to misspell) docbook won't install on his machine
but lyx docs are better than no docs :)
jamest: point being he doesnt need docbook neither do you
emacs will work
I've written 3 chapters of a manual
while he's trying to just get the dependencies
or any text editor
working
and goats or some other location with docbook can create the files
:)
"but thats besides the point, lyx is acceptable"
perfectlable acceptable :)
:)
derek: you have a URL w/ docbook rpms for jcater?
he needs it to create the output
my headache is getting worse
"lyx files are just latex, they can be hand edited as well :)"
"anyway, old battle"
ok
what's the debian apt-get ?
yeah
dcm's sight
er site even let m e dig it up
er latex
?
no worse than docbook IMHO
of course I deal w/ it more
frick
he redid his site
hmm
and moved the docbook stuff
vi techref.lyx
sorry
wrong window
"argh, pringles are the product of satan"
if you want i can put the rpms i have on this machine on goats
nak
actually
http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=docbook
rpmfind its a slow apt-get :)
for rpm
if you are on a redhat system though
go get the cd you installed from
it has docbook on the cd
i.e. its part of the distribution
slackware
"jcater ah, why did jamest ask for rpms?"
is ports collection available for slack yet?
!
dang thats wicked :)
"i have buttons to do things in xchat, i found you can highlight more than one user and do multiple application "
muhahahaha
sigh
this is your masta
an instant crappie slap to the whole channel
this is your masta on drigs
drugs
rolf
any questions?
is how you know im on drugs :)
i thought you used rh? 
I have an unfortunate server at work that has redhat on it
mm
sweet sweet apt
"good coder, extra donuts"
"course, I really do miss my freebsd"
be strong
they are toast (freebsd) state of confusion w/ windriver hanging them out to dry (IMO)
"ok, it's not much"
if you must BSD i suggest netBSD ;)
hmm
been meaning to install that in my fridge
one of those honeydo's
"yea, what was up with that Wind River thing?"
jamest: what's not much?
"we need to test GNUe on our toaster anyhow, so having someone that is netBSD friendly could be of use :)"
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release/gnuef-users-guide/
netbsd is funky monkey
looking at netbsd 'platforms' is truly amazing
yea
jcater: you'll notice some stuff in there I'm sure
algor     alpha     amiga     amigappc  arc       arm26     arm32     atari     bebox     cats     cesfic   cobalt    dnard    dreamcast  evbsh3    hp300     hpcarm    hpcmips   hpcsh     i386      luna68k   mac68k    macppc    mipsco    mmeye     mvme68k   netwinder  news68k   newsmips  next68k   ofppc     pc532     playstation2  pmax      prep      sandpoint  sgimips   sparc     sparc64   sun2      sun3      vax       walnut    x68
  x86_64   
to name a few
netbsd runs on a peice of tinfoil and a wet napkin
a port to your ass in in progress
jamest/jcater what did the netBSD dudes tshirts say?
it had an up arrow pointing to his head
"and said, ""my brain runs on netbsd"" (IIRC)"
yes i think you are correct
ho ho
sigh
jamest: what's the apt-get to get docbook working?
'minor' gripe and i will get flamed
apt-get install smgltools-lite
but i dont like that our screen shots are running a theme that obviously one desktop over another :)
bbw = bbq
lol
we have new screenshots?
derek: ?
jamest: this in cvs?
"a bbw bbq, um ill let you play that one"
by the way screenshot == image in the new doc :)
"derek: well, you got your pictures, didn't you?"
yeah
just got to that point
you wanna keep all those looser gnome themes consistant in the screenshot section there ya ximian lover?
"yeah the bbw at the bbq are great, got any with pantyhose though??"
is that a good flame?
"jamest: rofl, im not saying the screenshots have to be made on gnome, just use themes that are neutral"
i.e. on both gnome and kde so we dont piss off either camp :)
huh?
hell piss em both off and do all screen shots in windows
jamest: I think he is saying do all screenshots in lwm
you mean someone polluted kde's theme's with sawfish lookalikes?!?!?
flame count: 2
i have twm at work
fovl
i can do there
er rofl
i just mean use a theem w/o a K in the corner
"hell, it's X"
or a FOOT in the corner :)
I'll startup in failsafe w/o any window manager
sigh its not worth discussing was just something that popped in head
there ya go
i dont want to be a GNU/Linux'er
"sigh, if you think it's a big deal we can change"
there are definitely more important issues:)
and there is nothing wrong with KDE
"just want to avoid the wars in here later on, from one camp or the other"
of course not... we need something usable on linux
but honestly I figured we'd have lots of different ones 
btw - how we hide the "windows" ones
flame count: 3
jcater then stay away from ximian by all means :)
do the entire thing in fvwm
i mean ONLY in the docs
not talking screenshots on website
"ah, ok"
sorry for bad term in the beginning
i can do that
:)
"anyway, it's the start of a users guide"
as my users need one
"if people don't like it, it's in cvs, change at will"
"im all for making the screenshots on the website come from as MANY diff setups as possible, shows flexibility of gnue :)"
honestly lots of our docs are out of date
:(
i noticed that tonight reading them
report's docs are current
where im really thinking is like gnome documentation project makes all document shots use the same theme and window theme
txt and lyx  both
which is nice for consistency
but i wont go there :)
jamest: i will look at updateing docs
"i read the developers guide and was like, ouch"
"i'll let you guy figure that out, as I promised I'd be in bed at 10PM"
hmm
need to change some stuff :)
"and it's um, a little after"
it was amazingly still pretty consistent
just some new pieces have been added etc
I hate docbook
"dcl and coder whipping, documentation slave and 'alpha' as in lead tester"
provide a form:  Window Manager: [ Gnome  v]  WMTheme: [ Eggplant Yellow v]  Toolkit Theme: [ Wooden v]   [ Generate ScreenShot ]
it even bombed out of apt-get
jcater: it had bad things to say about you too
"jcater: but, but, it almost runs on all linux compatible systems!"
jcater: almost
its just not 'hick' compatiable yet :)
sigh
I guess that's it
but anyway
sigh
oooooooooooooo!
jamest: but you are making me install it
lets do them all in openoffice
jcater: im ashamed as we always just assumed jamest was doing apt-get docbuc
and we didnt have the heart to tell him to check his spelling
jamest: fine with me
"jcater: I'm not making you, honest"
I'm in the same boat as you
in trying to stay compatible w/ the docbook std for gnue :(
"grr, no python debs in sid"
I don't wanna have to "program" my docs
ajmitch: should be
"anyway, i really need to run"
l8r
run!
jcater: not hurd
lol
oh
"derek: btw, we have samples in the windows setup.exe now"
it's a selectable component
cool
so you can deselect it
i have LOTS o questions on new setup
our windows setup rocks!
"does it search for existing python, wx etc?"
s/taht/that/
it's a standalone setup
or does it not care and use dll's regardless
it does not use a local installation
even if it's there
"jcater: ok, thats what i thought"
guess that makes life easier and puts us in more control
wish we could make the unix setup that damn clean and good looking
sigh
derek: isn't that what "apt-get" is all about?
kind of
apt-get is not universal
it's not?
i.e. it would meet needs of our debian users
but debian is only 1 of many distributions
and 9 out of the top ten used distros dont use .deb's or apt
so that would go against the grain of gnue by making it hard to use for a majority of our audience
isn't that what redcarpet is for?
or whatever they call it?
redcarpet and other rpm based apt knock offs are prop at best
i.e. they are not well licensed and need the software in them to be part of 'partner agreements' from the content providers
which i think is something we would like to avoid
i dont see why a setup.sh is so evil
i just installed SimCity3000 for linux
sh setup.sh
and 3rd most beautiful install i have ever done
behind rail road tycoons 2 and civilization call to power
"yea, loki puts out good stuff"
open office has a nice install too
nite
nite
setup.sh isn't a bad way either
"however, as you point out they're all non-standard and reasonably evil"
im not saying there is only one way to skin a cat either
hmm
what disadvantages do you precieve just providing a .rpm?
"loki's installer is available under the GPL, iirc"
I believe that you are correct
of course ;)
http://www.lokigames.com/development/setup.php3
cool
btw: how do you get x to run on another display?
derek: how do you mean? get X apps to run elsewhere?
"export the display on the client side, set the server side to accept the clients"
nickr: ok how
basically i just normally do startx
but now i want x on more than one display on same machine
i.e. in past i let X run on diplay 0
startx -- :1
then use ctrl-alt f2-6 to play around
gets X to start up on :1
ok let me try it
if that don't work use xinit -- :1
aj think you :)
i was trying 
startx --client :2
unfortunately it doesnt like me having two x sessions 
the mozilla plugins freak
but still its a start
"i use gdm, it lets me just click a toolbar button & i get a new xsession :)"
bbl
hi aj/anyone else awake
nope
bbl
hmm
hmm?
hmm!
what are you up to?
trying to get python packages
for GNU/Hurd
howdy
hey
sigh
and the morning was going so well
rofl
dont mind me just checking email and moving along
jcater: maybe we should change to 3rd shift
i was up during 3rd shift just paying simcity (im an addict now)
"so, you were up late, eh?"
how's that demo form going?
not too late
"yeah, yeah"
like 1:30 or so and no form
you say that now
man
i saw we dock his pay
saw = say
btw : you were asking for things intern and full timers could do
finish up the configuration tool so that individual installs can tweak the gnue.conf file
explore the idea of a GNUe Navigator to make it easy to find the reports/forms/etc via task
(also would be tied into config tool so that new forms could list their availability)
The integrator project
and I won't even touch on all the current stuff needing done
"well, ok, I will...."
geas work 
hrm
who died and elected you goat masta?
"lots of TODOs in forms, common, designer"
:D
"well, now that simBoy is too busy to boss us arround"
someone has to do it
:)
"man, no comebacks from derek?  Must be busy on that new waste treatment plant in the new development section"
hi all
"actually, I thought derek had asked for a list"
so I just gave him one that I thought of this morning
waaaaaaaaaaaah
look out it's meee
the GNU nazi
sigh
and the morning was going so well
all others will be holocaust'd
rock! I just broke everyone's gnue.conf!
"er, I mean, oops"
you must accept GNU or die
jamest: how so?
yeah <snicker> oops is what I meant <snicker>
I removed the prefix option
mine.conf
o <cough>bullshit</cough> k
mein.conf
there ya go
mein.conf....heil GNU
and all the image entries in there started with %(prefix)s
now they are relative to the install dir
this also make only one sample needed
s/nto/not
not a windows and a unix sample
there will be no constructive things happening here today
dude
why can't I change the topic
you friggin topic nazis
wake up!!!!!!!!!!!
dang chillywilly
thois channel is lame
how much coffee did you drink this morning??
none
0
zip
nadda
fineto
not a damn drop
well I demand that the topic changing be made public or that I be made an op
or else there will be fish slappin' to pay
damn channel topic nazis
some year we need to go to the Python conferences
"ahhhh, woody went to kde 2.2"
jamest: ?
kde 2.2 is for windows wannabees
;P
There are two major products that come from Berkeley : LSD and UNIX. We don't believe this to be a coincidence. Jeremy S. Anderson
lol
:)
sigh
bbl
anyone used bayonne ?
nope
:P
j/k
smomeone here may have used it
someone even
i have 
"BUT let me preface that by saying the bayonne team set absolutely everything up, i just used an installed and configured version"
to do voice mail demos at linux world expo in our booth
so if you are looking ofr a successful use or some features etc i can speak to that
if you are looking for techincal support you are probably asking wrong fellow
:)
"dneighbo: I was just wondering if it can do this (i am completely clueless about terminology): have it answer the phone, asks for a extension, and depending on it, it routes it... "
is this a "pbx"?
yes it can do that
and do voice mail on top of that
ohh nice :)
"if anyone's interested, I'm currently looking at "
a form that is pulling data from 
an MS Access database via ODBC
"(the free ODBC, not that non-free mxODBC stuff)"
wicked cool
im interested
though i dont want to admit it 
what is free ODBC?
the free python odbc adapter :)
for those freaking out (chilly)
the reason this is cool as now we know integrator can be made to convert people from access to postgres :)
lol
    if cnt == index and self.isEmpty():
"      print ""Bad, bad, bad"""
      raise IndexError
can't argue w/ diagnostics like that
that is good who did that
i always liked mdeans message
'so hard to find good help now a days'
or something to that affect on features that partially work :)
jcater: you here?
here
i thought you were there?
no
I was there
but now I'm here
i wonder how you got from there to here and here to there and back again
most interesting
if I need to pass additional commands to database after get connection is it a good idea to put it into _postConnect() def
ra3vat you not using forms?
i.e. you just using common?
um
or you using forms and making a new trigger type of postConnect?
dneighbo: that's a gnue-common DBdriver command
ra3vat: what are you trying to accomplish?
"yes, that's the place things like that would go if working on a new driver"
"but if you are having to customize one of our drivers for your environment, "
then we may need to do something else
it was done some days in old postgresql driver
as jason stated what are you trying to achieve 
I need for example to
i.e. what do you plan to do in teh postConnect code?
 c = self._dataConnection.cursor()
    c.execute("SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'WIN'")
ooh
jcater you think this should be another item in the connection file?
wht does that do?
dneighbo: ues
like
"err, yes"
client_encoding = WIN
jcater: sets postgresql locale
and it is what ENCODING param in gnue.conf is for
ok
ra3vat would it be acceptable to just have this as a value in in your connections file?
jcater remind me to talk to mdean about date/time stuff 
if client and database encoding are different it gives postgresql info to recode data on the fly
"dneighbo: yes, may be connections.conf would be better"
"jcater is quiet, so quiet i wouldnt be suprised if he returns in a second and says its done and in cvs :)"
ok
that and ODBC support are committed
add an encoding=WIN to your connections.conf file
jcater: thanks
np
"hey, is this true?  php-nuke.org developer has ""orphaned"" the project?"
"oh, apparently its not"
~~bbl
yes its true
from what i can tell
?
php nuke is forked and php somethign else is its place
jamest: originally php nuke was closed source but free
then the guy opened it up
Mandrake is supporting it?
post-nuke
and he got funding
and he got ego issues
and closed the source back up
post-nuke (thanks ra3vat) made a fork of the code
and has started to maintain the free version
post-nuke doesn't do multi-DBs tho yet :-(
basically hosing the original author (his own fault admittedly)
"ok, well bbl"
i thought nuke was gpl?
i guess not originally
but regardless a copyright holder can change their mind :)
is ./setup.py devel appropriate command for gnue-common?
no!
if president bush extended a bbq offer to president putin
shouldnt we extend that offer to ra3vat and the other russians on the list?:
i mean we could show them REAL barbeque (memphis or kansas city) style none of this hokey smokey texas tenderloin :)
plus i figure jcater couldnt pass up an offer to bbq
hmm
:)
NCS' president wins at practically every BBQ cookoff in the country
"so gnue meeting at ncs this summer, its final"
thanks for inviting us
lol
I still vote on vegas
ra3vat: you don't need to do that in common
only in forms and designer
they include common as part of the devel setup
if you are serious im WAY game to vegas
"its close, its cheap and my wife would have a blast"
hey tulsa is close too
hey
I can fly to vegas ~100
as that's a popular destination
works for me.... jamest?
comdex is next week in vegas you know 
show up on friday and hand out gnue literature why combing the floors then spend the weekend gnue'ing ;)
"unrealistic of course, but it sounds fun"
btw the windwos installer looks pretty good
getting ready to test on another machine
we still looking for a sample form?
lol
I was originally suposed to go to comdex
hmm mlooks like still 0.1.0a out there
but things got wierd around here
i thought a new one was made that included samples?
was it just never 'posted'?
if someone can build and post pretty quick i will gladly test
not created yet
please make a introduction form if you have time
maybe something that is on tabbed pages
i will right now
"with a button example, a trigger example"
if you can make an install :)
for .exe and post
as im behind firewall
a page or two of text
and want to test anyhow :)
can you use current exe's 
does odbc work with windows?
or do you need more
i would like a new one with the samples :)
I'm in the middle of a fire
but will try and make something in a bit
also if possible packaging jcaters odbc code
as then i can test DB2 for real
via ODBC
against the mainframe :)
which would seem fairly impressive to some
gnue forms windows client
:)
"talking to OS/390 on DB2 fetching 100,000 records in xx seconds"
would help prove we are serious about supporting real enterprises (a la mainframe) as well as supporting non linux clients and hetereogenous environments. :)
anyone seen this:
DB000: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/gnue///usr/local/gnue/shared/images/gnue-splash.png'
yip
gnue.conf changed in cvs
paths are now relative
ok
the sample.gnue.conf has been updated to reflect the change
sorry about that
we no longer require different gnue.conf for windows or *nix clients
cause we are studs ;)
jamest: seems that quick hack in UIwxpython.py does not work anymore:
          elif (1728 <= event.KeyCode() <= 1791):
            offset = 1536
"            action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS',chr(event.KeyCode()-offset))"
but new one:
          elif (192 <= event.KeyCode() <= 255):
"            action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS',chr(event.KeyCode()))"
works well for both windows and unix
with current tools
um
thats odd
odd?
why would the input codes have changed?
those in range 1728-1791 looked very strange
in range 192-255 looks better for one-byte encoding
and chr() deals only with 0-255 range covering most of pre-unicode encoding 
"derek, I'm sorry but you are mistaken.."
the only REAL BBQ comes from NC!!!
;-)
ra3vat: this is russian support only change right?
Mr_You now now
jamest: dont you wish you knew :)
my dad acquired an awesome BBQ chicken recipe.. drool
jamest: should be appropriate for others non-latin1 but I can't test
ra3vat: feel free to commit a patch 
i think you have cvs access right?
ok
ra3vat: can you also test this on windows?
"main diff between texas and eastern BBQ, I guess, is that Texas has a bunch of sauce... and eastern is more marinated"
jamest: i'll do tomorrow
and ask others to test also
some of us north carolinians are passionate about our BBQ hehe
if its pig BBQ and not marinated.. gotta have the Texas Pete handy (a NC hot sauce).... if its chicken marinated rocks
enough of my ranting
jcater: please take a look at the designer/src/Instance.py (def saveForm) I need something like:
"    fileHandle = open(location,'w')"
    enc = sys.getdefaultencoding()
    if enc == 'ascii':
        fileHandle.write('<?xml version="1.0"?>\n\n')
    else:
        fileHandle.write('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="%s"?>\n\n' % (enc))
ra3vat: have you tested that? does it work?
it does not work without that
if I have form with non ascii labels for example and "encoding" in xml header
"ok, committed"
designer erase "encoding" and then can't load that form again itself
problem is that same encodings named differently in different tools (in different places)
yeah
I'm still not sure how to handle this long term
jcater : with a big ugly stick
ra3vat you realize you are putting a real cramp on us to not be american biased
and we love you for it :)
:) 
 /msg dneighbo I thought we were going to pawn ALL i18n off on ra3vat?
:)
ra3vat: you a KDE luser?
bad ra3vat
hehe
you know this is valid c syntax?
x&=~y
yup
bit twiddlng stuff
yep
almost looks like perl :)
"chillywilly: yeah, i'm a KDE pawn :)"

"no good for Intel and HP, Itanium is failing Compaqs stress test"
hmm wonder how you do a /part msg
man!
women just do NOT get it!
baaah!
get what?
anything
they do not think rationally
trying to explain to wife why you spend more time with us than her again?
I don't spend time with your wife
:P
hehe
haha
I'd feel sorry for you if you did
uuuh
nah
I got it just as bad I am sure
"ok, I geta  joint checking account right"
then I put some money in there
mena while we put some money in hers to cover bills as we didn;t have checks yet
gah
she's claling me back
;)
run!
man she's so friggin lame
I don't care
she's being irrational
you should!
and aillogical
illogical
"phpGroupware is moving from sf to savannah, guess ya'll knew that"
yeah some women are completely illogical and don't tell you why.. you just have to always keep in your mind what the hidden message is hehe
"such as ""I realized I fudged up but I'm not going to admit it yet, but just bitch"""
hmmm... i dont think i would want a 'logical' wife
hehe
dneighbo: why not?
a logical wife is no wife at all
what?
"i wouldnt have any fun, man / wife is about complimenatary traits"
yeah
you logic offsets her illogical patterns and vice versa
i cant tell you how many times my wife's 'intuition' has saved my butt
to me it seemed illogical to just go on a 'feeling' but ill be darned if her feeling wasnt right
if you watch old star treks or new ones
"we laugh at the vulcans logic, but often times look in the mirror and thats us :)"
hehe
"now thats not to say illogically behavior cnat be frustrating as hell at times, but imagine how your logical behavior probably enfuriates her :)"
dneighbo: that's highly illogical
well i would say
fascinating
:)
heh
man I want to kill her
fuck this
no you don't
why do I even bother to talk to her anymore
she says the same shit over and over
cos you still love her
"chillywilly: there's only one way to get along with illogical, irrational women"
hehe
cause you keep doing the same wrong thing over and over
chillywilly: love them
chillywilly: anything else is bound to fail
ajmitch: what kinda box?
"reinhard: p100, 16mb ram, GNU/Hurd ;)"
why not?
you should see how slow it is ;)
maybe slow
but it should run
I wish I wa s a hermit
if ORBit is compiled for it
damn orbit dependency
yeah
"man sucks, my roommate is sorta being played by this girl/friend who he use to date.. everyone knows it cept him"
chillywilly: get working on removing those dependencies ;)
she ain't even given him any
he knows whats up I think.. just doesn't care to ditch their friendship
nite all
jcater you are a sick and twisted bastard
ms ado drivers... 
bbl
derek: yup.. almost done
I'm trying to provide an upgrade path for MS customers
and ODBC drivers will not support introspection
(so designer won't be quite as impressive running via ODBC)
but running native against MS Access/SQL Server/FoxPro
with full schema discovery
that's an upgrade path :)
it's part of my world domination fixation
fun
"BTW, maybe we could find someone in spain to represent GNUe at this espania conference (ferget the name, just found out today)"
hmm
sounds like a good vacation to me
"cool, jcater volunteers"
;-)
yip
IF
I can find a benefactor :)
and a translator? ;-)
"se habla english?"
"""um, GNUe is, um, grande"""
"si"
hehe
lol
I can just be like masta
"and learn the spanish phrase ""Yes, it can do that!"""
GNUe es muy grande por esta enterprise
"whatever they ask: ""Yes, it can do that!"""
yeah hehe
and repeat something like "Try demo here:"  
"you know, someone could just have a bunch of spanish written docs and signs.. and just stand there looking like typical dumb american ;-)"
lol
well they could make your effort and learn phrases like you said tho ;-)
Si!
basically what I did at LWE/San Fransisco
:)
(stand there and look like a dumb american :)
hehe
see thats our secret
thats my secret anyways.. let them underestimate us
hehe
and then...
BAM!
rofl
Users: "Where in the world did this GNUe come from and why am I using it?"
Us: "you will learn in time grasshopper"
"get wacky"
you smokin that wacky weed again?
you never know
time to cvs
I finally got a debian CD image made ;-)  time to start customizing one 
I need to do that
which?
download cd image
ahh
rsync is required for that I believe

is that get me some water my mouth is on fire please?
or something
the water dog makes me feel sick
mi lengueta esta en el fuego
doh thats right was thinking enfermo is fire but thats sick
getting french and spanish confused
mi lengueta esta en el fuego = my tongue is on fire
usually followed by
that's a sentence we translated and used while I was in Saudi
aqua por favor == water please
burrito jalisco
jalisco?
I dunno
:)
but it's my favorite dish at the local mexican place
could be rat for all I know
jcater: wazzup?
not much
a bug here
a bug there
did you happen to try a windows build?
uggh
no
I guess I need to reboot into Win98
:(
more bugs?
not any more
it'll be a while before I can do anything
got annother quiz to study for and some homework
sigh
let me know if it works
"whoops, wrong window"
hmm.. talking to those chicks in #kdegirlies again
#pythonweenies actually :)
hrrrm
rofl
"was that a spontaneous moment of self-reflection, derek?"
no laughing at
"<jamest> whoops, wrong window"
<jcater> hmm.. talking to those chicks in #kdegirlies again
<jamest> #pythonweenies actually :)
should be #livekdeteens or something
#livekdeteens must be a synonym for #debian
lyx requires non-free software
lyx rules
should that be acceptable for a GNU project?
chillywilly: did he type it on a non-free computer?
heh
Maniac: you make no fscking sense
:)
"chillywilly: basically, given the time frame we are in, it's either LyX documentation with this release, or no documentation for a while (until we can get some other stinking system in place)"
pick one :)
use docbook then
sheesh
sheesh
I've only wasted the last few days trying to get the fscking jade/openjade/docbook crap to install
"dude, I seriously get pissed at hacing to install non-free software for a GNU projects docs"
days that could have been spent WRITING docs
apt-get install blah onm ash
jcater: i've had that same problem which is why i resorted to lyx months ago
s/onm/on
chillywilly: I apt-got it and apt-got couldn't do it right EITHER!
how can I build the docbook docs then?
magic?
I honestly don't know
but apt-get docbook crap was broken as of last night
mmm i hope you all are developing on GNU/Linux and not windows.....
jcater: what are you using?
at the moment slackware and debian
but I will be rebooting slack into Win98 shortly
and I use Win98 + RedHat at work for development
cause you suck
but that's out of necessity
dude
if I can build this docbook stuff I can then bitch slap you all?
um
no
"btw, if LyX is such a big deal, we'll HAPPILY delegate this documentation stuff to someone else <hint, hint> as we'd rather be coding anyway :)"
lyx's graphics library is non-gpl
I'm not writing your docs for you
"this is an issue the developers are aware of but do not, at this time, have the time to rectify"
I'll have real GEAS docs to do soon
chillywilly: last I checked this is OUR project :)
Maniac: because they are fucking KDE nazis
"that's who the original lyz authors are mathhias, et. al."
lyx
matthias
"well, my understanding is, they are working toward UI independance, to make it able to use differnt toolkits ie. kde, gnome, xyz as time/coding permit"
jcater: I am supposed to document code I haven't hardly even looked at?
chillywilly: we aren't documenting code
Maniac: yes they are but until then it is not even functional without libxforms
the code is already documented
chillywilly: such is the cruel reality of life
jcater: I got  afew warning but html docs built
for the module guide
Maniac: shouldn't be the reality of GNU....use fscking texinfo then :P
chillywilly: so GNU projects cannot use non-GNU software in any portion of their project?
"no, they shouldn't use non-free software"
libxforms would reqwuire me to add non-free section to sources.list
thus I will not do it and cannot read the damn docs
can use non-GNU tho
sure
that's not my point though
"chillywilly: your KDE hatred is showing, btw"
I know
KDE is fine actually
wow
but then again they did use QT before it was actually free and then the original foundere goees and writes lyx with aq non-free GUI toolkit....so I have not much love for him
"shoudl get psu to put that in the KC, chillywilly admitting KDE is fine ;)"
cool
it's now my birthday
happy birthday jcater
do y'all know what I want for my birthday???
what?
I want chillywilly to get a clue!!!!
happy bday
rofl
"oh, that and Kahn's Codebreaker's book"
jcater: screw you....go use lyx
no madlocke?  :-(
"ajmitch: you mean the chinese year, right?"
jcater: ummm
death to LyX
grrrrrr
lyx rocks ;)
dude
as soon as some GNUtastic individual comes up with a GNUified Lyx i will stop using it
why do I need moderator approval to post to the list?
hmm
cos somebody doesn't like you?
they must've seen your language/temper in the main channel
oh damnit
wrong email
hehe
fuck
watch it
see
you scared ra3vat off
"no, I DOS'd his computer"
well
he's on a russian phone connection
"what did you do, ping it once?"
so it was easy :)
howdy
well?
it only took 1.5 hours of waiting in line
"jcater: dude, go eat an damn krispy kreme and go to bed"
jamest: don't say it
jamest: just the man I wanna bitch at
apt-get lyx &lt;----- wonder why that didnt work.....
but I gots me an Xbox
M$ is so cool
sigh
here we go
<cure chillywilly>
"err, cue"
oooo jamest XBox uses DirectX!
all the good gaming platforms do
:)
jamest: instaling LyX is not good for my soul
jamest: can you get me one?
but it doesn't require DirectX 
"chillywilly: i don't know what you did, but the lyx site is down"
ajmitch: they had some left
you seriously have an Xbox?
yip
it's in my lap
"directx rocks, can't we use it?"
jamest: this is the M$ game box?
i just came home and was typing while i unrap it
yup
"chillywilly: yip, ms's game console"
jamest: umm why do you have one?
jamest: you bought it?
"they bought the rights to Shenmue II, and thus own'd my arse"
chillywilly: I tried to just take it but they insisted I pay for it
"ok, jamest has sold out..."
"jamest: first lyx, then kde, now this!!"
hell yes he has
"dude, after spending the last two weeks as GNUe's bitch"
trying to get this release ready
don;t even say it
i have a little credit
because that is just unacceptable
enough for an xboxc
:)
nope
not the way I see it
:)
hmm
who in here asked for chillywilly's opinion?
raise your hands
jcater: who asked for yours?
jcater: next I'll be setting up my pasport account
and riding the .NET
that figures
"jamest: yeah, to play shemnu"
chillywilly: jamest is anathema
"anyway, I've got to go see if this thing will work with my 20yr old tcv"
tv
:)
jamest: i tried setting up passport but it said i had to upgrade from IE3.0
l8r guys
l8r
get SOME rest :)
this one has been bought
Maniac: aren't we sure of ourself?
lol
jcater: nice way to read that :)
"oh, DOS'd him too"
 /msg Maniac do that to chillywilly
nite all
ok i'm going to read my python book 
better?
really?
fucking wuss
he's lucky he left
or?
"well, it's been fun"
night
all;
bye
isn't it funny how ppl wanna ignore you when they know you are speaking the truth?
yet they can't stand to hear it
hi reinhard
morning
"reinhard: dude, should somone using GNU project software be required to install non-free software in order to read and edit the documentation?"
"i.e., install LyX which require non-free xforms in order to read the and edit the forms documentation"
am I craxy for thinking this is shitty?
nope
i think having to use lyx is wrong for a GNU project
but i
've had this discussion before
and i lost
well I agree with you
I will NOT install lyx and make vrms unhappy
cool.. this savannah software is a good thing
oh sorry
there's another valid documentation format i forgot
text/plain :)
"""We've finished our beer, it's time to win our freedom. "
:)
"
thats cool heh
"hmm, i still have a savannah account..."
maybe we should move to SF since it is more feature filled than savannah and hell it's easier to use
they want you to sign over all your rights
exactly
so the answer is no
heh
"well, no"
it is more convienient that way
just like lyx is
dammit we shoudl switch to windows for development
yeah
it's much easier ;)
noooo
we should target the Xbox
sigh: You're not a member of any public projects 
get gnue running on the Xbox
on savannah
I want to run GNUe on my apple airport
Mr_You: xbox is made by M$
i want gnue to run on my gnu/hurd box
chillywilly since when?  ;-))
well I wasn't sure you were getting my sarcasm
our minimum server configuration will be a 486DX w/ 16MB of RAM
and a 1GB HD
Mr_You: i have a p100 w/ 16mb ram
and 1gb is used for gnu/hurd ;)
"yeah, it would be very minimal install heh"
hehe
it's a little slow ;)
am trying to compile geas now
is texinfo hard to learn?
is it any worse than docbook?
there can be worse?
hell I had to read the whole damn book to use it
(docbook)
"woo, i'll see if this compile actually gets off the ground"
I bet if I were to go through th trouble of converting all the docs and making templates for various types of docs they stll would use lyx
yep
reinhard: we need to be the txinfo police
hmmm.. we'll need a web cvs interface for webware ;-)
ehh people will still want php module installed regardless heh
Mr_You: sorry?
huh?
"i am gonna be using webware a fair bit this summer (need it to do some websites), so i will be able to learn it :)"
what web cvs interface for webware?
oh I was just dreamin.. 
ok
you mean a webcvs thing written with webware?
yeah I'd like to get madlockes code so I can start playing with GNUe and web integration very soon
yeah
"hmm, we need to put hot coals under madlocke..."
like a sf port to webware ;-)  (why not?) ;-)
"well, chillywilly &amp; i are already planning a phpnuke-like forum using webware"
yeah.. will bug jamest about madlocke tommorow or so
"well, i am, i guess; )"
yeah cool
we hope to make it a GNU project
I would like to begin work on a GNUe CMS app
"yea, we thought that gnue web forms and geas would make a nice base for it"
"mmm, this could be useful"
too bad I cannot read the damn forms tech reference without being a non-free whore
bitch moan bitch moan
(yes I am not gonna let it go)
or by using klyx
which is old as dirt
yeah
"apparantly it was a stright port from kde 1.1.2, unmaintained apart from that"
and you get bugs like massive fonts
1.1.2?
yes
it doesn't worj with the newer kde?
"yeah, it does"
k
"but it was ported from old kde, no changes"
apart from porting
"dammit, i can't compile stuff"
"probably half the libs, etc are antique"
we should just use friggin texinfo
yes
"texinfo is GNU standard, right?"
yes
cvs update: cannot read entries file: Input/output error
cvs update: cannot rewrite CVS/Entries.Backup: Read-only file system
cvs [update aborted]: cannot open CVS/Entries.Log: Read-only file system
wth?
ouch
where you trying to update on?
"those errors are on your local machine, i think"
something is read only
but i could be wrong ;)
"ok, I sjould code for  bit before going to bed"
one HD has I/O problems..
not sure if its the cable tho
both HDs are I guess
had to force an fsck on reboot bleah
ouch
good thing only the deb mirror is on the &lt; 60GB ;-)
I've had problems with these Seagates before.. I seriously hope its not a HD problem again but something with the machine/cable cause these are new HDs
old machine
ah those lovely seagates
just toss the fscker out the window :P
"yeah, one seems to be working fine for a while now"
"I dunno, but this cable might be going bad, cause they both failed to show up til I double checked cables.. "
the connections that is
yuck
"sigh oh well, see where this is gonna go"
uggh
Hi reinhard
hi sacha
"I mentioned once, that I will do a masters in cs next year. I will do it in relation with ebXML and maybe your gnue. In February 2002 I will go back to Liechtenstein (from Australia). Is it possible to meet you then?"
previous message is for reinhard :)
sacha: sure
if you don't meet me in irc to fix an appointment
you can write a mail to reinhard@gnue.org
reinhard: cool. I guess that will be around 10th February. OK. I write down your email. ta
I am looking forward to next year. I will go to Sweden to meet a guy from www.openebxml.org as well. I am really looking forward to :)
maybe a short comment: the ebXML standard wants to create a global electronic marketplace. With ebXML companies have the possibility to define (and re-use) business process including their document exchanges. Defined is also the structure of the documents within a "business transaction". The content could come from a ERP system. :)

on the telephone just somebody said to me

any html dudes here?
anybody can tell me if there is something like an #include in raw html?
i have several pages and i want a part of the page look the same for all pages
reinhard: only if your server supports Server Side Includes
but those are usually considered security risks
um 
then i guess they don't support it
no other chance?
do i have to enter the header and that stuff into every single document page?
chillywilly: what the fuck were you thinking sending an email like that to our public list???
what the fuck were you thinkin making me have to install non-free software?
no on e made you install crap
I still cannot read the forms tech reference
sigh!
well that's what I would have to do in order to read it
it was in the last tarball release in text format!
and IIRC html!
install libxform0.88
and on the web in HTML!
and if I wanna change something? I mean are all GNUe sources gonna be in friggin lyx?
vi works real good on .lyx files
oh that is crap
um
and docbook has a better editor!
no more so than docbook
lyx uses it's own little commands
not like i can just look th shit up
we shouls use texinfo then if docbook is such a hassle
i wrote all the fucking docs in texinfo and that wasn't good enough
so it was docbook
why would it not be good enough?
which is great if you can build the tools
however i can't
and it's not from lack of trying
nor can I
what was wrong with texinfo?
don't ask me as I don't know
people wanted docbook
we did docbook
and the docs went from being a few large files
you can go texinfo-&gt;docbook
to lots and lots of files
and a fuckload of utilities that you can build on any system as long as it's some sub-derivative of GNU/Linux
look I am not tryint to be a jerk I just cannot stand the fact of how contradictory it is to have to use lyx when I cannot get a free gui for it yet...it sucks
it really comes down to this
if people want docbook that is fine with me
and what if you wanna hack docs on the serve?
fuck docbook I want texinfo :P
however the people that are willing to put the effort into the user_guide and tech_ref (jcater and myself)
fuck it all... read the source code!
are sick of fighting docbook
so it's either docbook and no docs from us
"yes, so dump it then it is not worth it...but lyx has issues for others too"
yes it does
we don't have a good solution
but we're trying to get docs made
psu: I don't think this discussion should be in the KC
how about plain ol' text then for now until you decide to format it
:P
I casn read that wihout being installing evil software

jamest: I can figure your Xbox pruchase if you install GNU/Linux on it :P
from a spam email
We are running out of our earths most precious resourse---WATER.
tell me again how we are running out of water?
lol
the friggin planet is 2/3 water
that's hilarious
and to those saying oceans dont count
"um, dneighbo: fresh water is a BIG prob"
guess they have never heard of desalination?
expensive
and not doable in many areas
"dneighbo: yes, ToyMan is right"
"toyman expensive perhaps, but far from saying we dont have water"
mind you im not saying go and waste water
don't have / can't afford &lt;- same thing
"the main aquafir (sp?) in the west, the ogoala ##$%^@#%$% (whatever)"
is running dry
which means the price of all the agri that comes from there will go up
or the agri will go away
"i dont think we will have issues with water, (i.e. i think other problems will plague us first)"
on a global scale
yeah
like LyX usage :)
maybe not.  It's a big issue in a lot of places
heh
yes
i think to certain areas
and certain industries
water sources are an isse
we had htis discussion on oil
for example if oil got outrageously expensive because we were running low we would cope
as long as there are whales to be slaughtered we will have oil right?
i.e. people wouldnt be using good old gas guzzling SUV's etc
and technically people lived for a long ass time w/o need for 'electricity'
sorry not that kinda oil
etc
i think water shortages would be similar
you cannot live without water
"i think people would adjust,but anyhow this is the gnue channel"
you will die
chillywilly this is true but industries that 'hog' water or 'regions' that hog water would adapt
that's the terrorists next move
"for example, i wouldnt have grass in arizona"
cutt off the fresh water supply
if water was expensive here
and it SHOULD be expensive here as we are in the friggin desert
but its not :)
you water hog you
:P
yes i am
you have grass?!?
i make up for it in energy consumption though
im a cheap bastard and electricity is expensive here :)
which is funny
"water == we make none, have none == cheap"
electricity == two huge power plants + nuclear power plant == expensive
go figure
i think with electricity the kicker is that california is such a hog
yea
that they can sell so much there at 3x what they to us
damn CA
our price reflects that
crap i forgot we have hoover dam making electricity too
so 4 major plants
in fact i think we supply more energy to calif / nevada than they do themselves
dneighbo: fwiw 50% of wars on earth of last 100 years were/are about water
that makes no sense as to why your electricity is expansive then
expensive
neilt: you ok with my mail?
rm-away: really?
yes
"chillywilly: if you look close enough, yes"
neilt: cool
"just sent a response, but I am ok anyway"
chillywilly: for example the wars in israel
the main points about golan etc are who controls the water resources of the area
anyway i'm now really away :)
"rm-away : i disagree, i think 85% of the wars on earth have been about religion :)"
"well actually have be about power, but fought in the name of some religion :)"
dneighbo: not on religion
dneighbo: on power
dneighbo: water == power
just like oil == power
hello
hi
l8r
duh
its a netspliting world out today eh
um the last 3 reconnects were on my side
jcater can you please respond to the fellow on the list asking for help
i woudl but am actually busy for a bit
I'll try
and dont have newest cvs and i know the path location stuff changed because of windows installs for gnue.conf
but I know nothing of GEAS
i think he is fine on geas
as he says it starts no errors
and created the tables
which is what a functioning one does
so i think he is good to go there
i will respond as well
but if you can address the forms/designer/etc installs and get his images etc working
i will address the other areas
ok
we really need a good and simple webpage
which basically says
yes
i started to look at phpnuke
"""GNUe is not yet there, we have only parts of it"""
and i think we can make it work
we get so many mails lately saying things like
"""i downloaded gnue, so where can i enter my invoices now?"""
:)
as there is some of its DEFAULT stuff that hogs space and hides the important links lower
i.e. i think we can still have the news and such
just need to make it easier to find things
and probably make the news section smaller and start lower
and have a blurb above where news is now
that states links to common things
like status pages
how to install
"dneighbo: just an idea, please don't flame me:"
and HOW to HELP
what about
a rather static page for an overview of the project
thats what gnu.org is for
its just not been maintained
im not against static for the most part
the idea was dynamic would make it easier to let OTHERS maintain 
as it takes 8 months to get a gnu account
so if fred says i'll help maintain the website
you either end up mailing patches around
or you wait 8 months to get him an account
which is NOT ideal
however the current way isnt working famously either
:)
i had hoped to get some more things going as well
and will do so with install of dcl etc
"but i dont want to put much time into it, so any volunteers"
********************************
Can I have people test a new 
Windows installer binary
at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/prerelease
Let me know of any problems
"Also, this version supports ODBC!"
********************************
<reinhard> what about
<reinhard> a rather static page for an overview of the project
"<reinhard> and a static pages each for the several parts of the architecture (forms, reports...)"
<reinhard> those static pages could be on www.gnu.org/projects/gnue
<reinhard> and on the top of www.gnuenterprise.org we have something like
"<reinhard> ""if you want to know what gnue is actually, please look _here_"
<reinhard> "
<reinhard> so no matter if i come from gnu side or from gnuenterprise.org
<reinhard> i always are directed to the same information
<reinhard> --
is what i wrote while being disconnected :)
http://freespace.virgin.net/andrew.harrison4/
"reinhard that is fine, but really tehre is a dynamic page for each of those already"
just no one has maintained it
so static or dynamic i think is not the point
we need someone to MAINTAIN the website
that is the REAL problem :)
IMHO
as we had SAME issues when we only had gnu.org site
it was grossly outdated
the new site was supposed to encourage people to help update
it hasnt done that and has made things harder to find
(sigh)
anyone testing those prereleases for me????
i think with a little work we could make it easier to find
and hopefully encourage others to help maintain
jcater: what prerequisites do i need?
Windows
i will test it 
lol
let me get actuals imported here first
jcater: what else?
reinhard: it's fully self-contained
python etc?
"it supports ODBC, PostgreSQL, and MySQL out of the box"
reinhard: nope
this is it
"pretty nifty, eh?"
nope = nope you don't need it it's contained
or 
nope = nope it's not contained?
the former
kewl
all you need is this executable
but i need a db right?
well
"ok, I give you that :)"
"yes, you need a database backend :)"
k
"well, actually not necessarily"
any forms that run w/o database?
our helloworld2.gfd file runs w/o database
k
plus designer can design without databases
can you give me url again? (i think i was disconnected at that time)
already found it
<nitpicking>
"the Start menu folder should be named ""GNU Enterprise"", not ""GNUe"" IMHO"
</nitpicking>
ah yes and
agree
it didn't tell me to reboot windows after installation
this can't be correct
j/k
the README.txt file contains a reference to INSTALL.win32
oh sorry seems that README.txt is not valid for me anyway
um seriously i am impressed
this is near unbelievable
i have been away from forms too long
the installer looks great
only thing maybe in the start menu a item is created for gnue forms
which issues an error
because no form is given
ping
is this installer python specific
or can we use it for c programs (geas) too?
(once they run under windows)
"reinhard: sorry, back now"
it's Inno setup
a generic free installer
(nothing python about it)
"also, we are aware of the Icon issue "
I think we're gonna do a Welcome form that is executed by default
if someone selects GNUe Forms from the Start menu
is this configurable?
what do you mean?
"well, if you can configure which form is displayed"
then you can make it load the "opening" form of your application
"In that respect, all you have to do is create a shortcut pointing to your GFD file"
yeah I know
and clicking that will automatically open that form
I just thought it might be a nice touch to make the opening form customizable :)
shrug
Feeping Creaturisms!
:)
Error: Error while communicating with datasource
Error: parser: parse error near or at "::"
for samples/geas/
uh
crap
i think i should try another form
sorry i didn't say anything :)
how can i populate a db for usage with a specific form?
what are you not believing?
um at first sight i would say
"hey jcater has reimplemented delphi"
:)
"joy, exchange down for 4 hours now"
and no ETA
and I can NOT open outlook w/o exchange connection
and i have critical file that is in email
so i cant get work done
isnt this lovely
jcater: this stuff is so great i can't even find words for it
btw: reinhard its not delphi (YET)
dneighbo: was just teasing you :)
im working on getting him to re do the UI slightly so it will be a delphi/vb clone
wrt to layout
as i think both those company sunk millions in UI testing
"and since both are similar probably pretty effective, but it still kicks butt :)"
and not bad for all the cash we have dumped into jcater
i mean i think he has spent more on gnue than we have paid him :)
how do i add a new control to a form?
Right-click on the grid area
btw i can't close a property editor window once it popped up
PrettySoon(tm) we will have icons
that you click to create objects
yep
block1-&gt;new-&gt;label
but i see nothing
sigh
"see, that's why we put these out for ppl to test :)"
i must say this is impressing
anybody knows how to supress this message?
"Warning: Remote host denied X11 forwarding, perhaps xauth program could not be run on the server side."
ssh -X
or ssh -x
when i use ssh implicitely? (e.g. in cvs)
depending on version (ssh1/ssh2)
unsetenv DISPLAY :))
or use some wrapper around ssh and set CVSRSH to it
"i can't do that when i am working in xterm, can i?"
unset DISPLAY i mean
CVS_RSH
"you can, but you cant start new windows from this xterm"
i made a wrapper
sevik_: thanks a lot
np :))
another helpfull thing - check for SUDO_USER and using it in -l to ssh :))
so you can sudo cvs commit/sudo cvs update/etc
why should i want that?
i use cvs for some configs :))
ah
which owned by root usually :))
ok
understand
any word on the web ware code from madlocke?
what exactly was madlocke looking at doing?
chillywilly its coming
webcode?
webware ?
webware.sf.net
webware
 bye
what is it with you guys and python?
nickr: python rocks :)
you a perl weenie?
nickr: speed and managability
"I like perl, but I don't think its a good language for doing big things in"
speed=speed of deployment
I'm more into objective C although I'm finding it very tedious lately
maybe gonna get into smalltalk instead
nickr : python == twice the oop + .5 * effort
"Still, I think smalltalk is forme"

re
hi Mr_You
"hi Mr_You, psu"
nite all
I like the comment on the gnue front page
from zllsy
"if these products keep you from implementing your business plans, something is gravely wrong. "" "
"of course, it may be the business plan itself that is wrong"
There's got to be some sort of sensible middle ground
between the Oracle/Ellison "no customisations" approach
(a.k.a. "Have it your way with Burger King")
s/your/our
s/Burger King/SAP
and the sort of stuff you get
"""the product must do X, because we've always done it that way"""
I suppose it's inevitable that my freedom as a hypothetical GNUe user
to add in my own business processes that give me competative advantedge
is also someone else's freedom 
to re-write GNUe to conform to out-of-date business practices
I suppose a GNUe consultant will have to be more honest
in that the answer to the question 
"Can the s/w be made to do X"
is always "Yes"
"but the correct answer may be ""Yes, but why do you want to?"""
lol
how true
#include chicken-sexing.py
or other hypothetical business process
</rant>
"but why would you want chickens, when you can have GOATS!"
uh oh...
never mind goats
I was reading a linux mag 
on the bus to work today
&amp; got a sudden uncontrollable urge
to get a cuddly penguin
they look so cute...
lol
I think our mascot should be a MULE myself
our=GNUe
as it gets no respect
but is one hell of a workhorse
but is hardworking
"but goats are fine, too :)"
and kicks out if aggrevated
?
"i get called an ass enough, no need to tag it on a tshirt i might wish to wear :)"
rofl
jcater: any particular's you wish me to test with your prerelease?
goats eat anything
"if possible, odbc"
GNue works with any d/b
i downloaded and was going to try to build a form for front in
co-incidence? 
I think I should be told 
and then test db2 odbc :)
"or at any rate, told off"
dneighbo: designer/win32 is having "issues"
that I'm working on
http://www.linuxemporium.co.uk/images/peng03.jpg
plus i already ordered jamest and jcater thier 'bells'
"if you add an object, it never shows up"
i.e the bells that go around the 'goats' neck
jcater: yeah would be good to fix that :)
dood was gonna suggest open in designer
and its already there
this install ROCKS :)
i might start using the windows version :)
j/k
testinmg with odbc
do you use the datasource name wehre it says service?
yes
jcater big troubles little china
a. i think reinhard pointed out no CLOSE/MINIMIZE on property editor
b. i get serious errors when trying to edit a form in designer
basically i picked up a sample form
and was going to connect it to my db
i was able to set teh datasource to a connection
and a table
then set the blocks to the datasource
but if i try to change the FIELD property of a widget i get an error
hi derek 
;)
an error?
ok now i can paste the message
DB000: AttributeError: CharCellEditor instance has no attribute '_tc'
DB000: Traceback (most recent call last):
"DB000:   File ""C:\PYTHON21\gnue\designer\PropertyEditor.py"", line 228, in Starti"
ngKey
bbl
sigh
ok odbc seems to barf
let me get the errors
btw: tab doesnt work on the login box :)
i.e. to tab from username: to password:
hmmm maybe i should do a new form
hey dneighbo_
kick tail it works
jason odbc on windows using postgres backend works
rock!
I tested against MS Access 2000
when my machine with db2 on it gets free i will test odbc windows
against db2 :)
ToyMan_ fwiw i tested using your membership table which i converted long ago to postgres :)
if thats any consulation :)
consolation?
jcater i did find that before release we should remove all sample forms :)
"bah, spelling is for english majors"
as i was going off an old one which when i looked had serious issues :)
ok
TAB issue on login box is fixed
we should include 1. non db form that shows some stuff
and 2. a db form that we provide a script for
im half tempted to say for 0.1.0 just the single one will be ok
and 0.1.1 can include the new stuff
?
AS one thing i want to do is make it use mdeans stuff with xslt
but i dont want to hold up the train
i.e. on teh sampel that uses db aware we will need to provide a 'create script'
wanting to use the db tool mdean made for dcl :)
so we do one xml file and a few 'transformation' files
well i guess in the distro
we would just ship with diff sql files
so maybe we can do as part of 0.1.0 
how's the view?
brb
"jcater: dark, but warm"
funky smell
smell like 2 day old pizza?
no 2 day old pizza smells good
my butt doesnt
it smells like a box of krispy kreme's
AN EMPTY BOX
in other words its painful :)
lol
I thought that smell was all the dead trout laying around
rofl
wait till the crappies start to rot
oh i have mysql installed
if i can remeber how to use it :)
oh good
we haven't tested the win32 mysql driver yet
whips
chillywilly: stfu
?
shut the fsck up
:D
fuck off
"kids, keep it clean"
jcater: do you have a problem with me?
I have no problems with anyone
why do you ask?
then take your own advice
trout whipping is a joke you know
haha
funny funny
ok mysql is installed and i have an odbc driver
now if i can configure the darned thing :)
crap its not REALLY installed
sigh
downloading now
crapity crap crap
anyone know if there's an emacs command to search for a string in all open buffers? 
Ctrl + Backslash??
lemme see
rm -rf
pffft
crap
have set to only allow localhost
dont know how to shut that off in mysql
rm -rf /bin/mysqld
:P
sigh
I feel old :(
you are old
sheesh
my wife wants me to cook dinner on my birthday :(
well that is crap
ok mysql tested
whooo hooo jcater if i liked windows i might be impressed :)
ok if enough room then no sweat :)
oops wrong channel

"yes, that's standard fare with our 0.1.0 released"
:(
ok
i want to test on db2 darn it
but have jobs running in background so will have to wait until tomorrow :(
I dunno if I'll be on tonight :(
thats ok
I'm taking my birthday evening off :)
happy brithday jcater :)
brithday even
damnit
"happy bidet, jcater"
I can't type it
thanks
how old are you now?
0x36
hex?
gah
happy bday
wow old enough to spout hex off top of head
thats pretty old
lol
thanks
although that isn't my real age :)
0x18 would be my real age :)
or octal 030 in octal
wow
that was redundant
hopefully you dont cruise before i get to test db2
in oracle must you do table namespacing?
like here table names are
somenamespace.tablename
im worried the . might hose thigns ups
um
"actually, that will hose our combo boxes"
but I think that's all
I want to change the way combos are handled
ok access 97 odbc works too
so
mysql
pgsql
msaccess97 
verified 
now for looking at db2 :)
rock!
KICK ASSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it works
"just queried up about 60,000 records w/ db "
dude!
and it didn't crash??
gnuef connects to mainframe db2
no
BUT
it doesnt display cursor right
i.e. it says 1/1
then if you hit next it says 2/2
etc :)
yeah
the reason being
i assume this is normal w/ odbc
as i have seen it happen before
is odbc doesn't tell you the number of queries returned
"and we don't want to load all 60,000 just to get the count :)"
but we do workarounds as we have time
actually i LIED
just haven't had time for odbc yet
its only 31612
records
this is SERIOUSLY cool
arrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this sucks
sucks
sucks??
jcater you realize if you didnt threaten to leave i wouldnt have tested that :)
lol
just wanted to make that clear :)
i need to get linux db2 drivers working
so i can test our native support
yes
this is SOOO huge for me here
windows and db2 both
separate and together
i mean really huge
only reason i havent pressed gnue more here
is client installs were fugly
now this would be EASIEST install i have to maintain :)
we need text driver asap :)
jamest and I actually gave up on a windows install for 0.1.0 last Friday
if we had one i could use gnue right now :)
we need to release monday :)
regardless of state
yes we do
even if its not a 0.1.0
:)
dneighbo_: we are by far a 0.1.0 level quality of work
at least forms client is :)
designer needs more polishing
"but, eh, we're getting there"
yip
"bbs, happy bday if i dont see you before i come back"
must run upstairs for a bit
l
"err, ok"
Stuart: hello
hi jcater
ToyMan: hello
:)
left my xchat up @ work ;)
nick is taken
"god, my unix networking learning curve is painful"
:)
Stuart you see in the log i used some of your tables (on postgres) to test out odbc driver for windows for jcater
thought it might peak your interest a bit :)
if designer worked better on windows i'd really start playing some
working on it
jcater you have account on ash that has access to anything?
I have ash + root on ash
why?
i want to start dcl install
but dont have postgres account to create the tables
cant create dcl.sourceforge.net
er
dcl.gnuenterprise.org
etc etc etc
but i dont want you spending your time doing that
"as i would rather see you coding up forms, designer, reports :)"
dneighbo_: glad you could use it :)
:)
it was all i had on postgres at work on test server :)
so easier than making own db for a test :)
bye all

does XForms have any limitations?
they are talking about the W3C standard right?
yep they are
I wodner if GNUe would benefit form using that standard
It would replace our Forms client methods?
"probably wouldn't be hard to integrate X-Forms clients at somepoint, or redo GNUe Forms to use X-Forms methods instead"
"yes, but I dunno if they would do it though"
:P
"BTW, I mainly do CGI perl coding.. so python should be cool"
"X-Forms might be limiting for what we need, dunno"
well neither do I
I like this "O Death" song tho its used in a KKK ralley in the movie heh
first heard it from this "Beethoven" band... ferget their name
mornin
evening
ahh
night
hmm
howdy
yay
:)
"so, what's up w/ release?"
I'm ready
derek test all his forms?
I dunno
he wasn't on much
ah
ok
you play with the mcmillan stuff at all?
no
"I fixed a few oddities in GFClient, though"
and did my comprehensive README.databases
(which I'd appreciate if someone looked over)
I can do the mcmillan stuff today I'm sure
where is it?
gnue-common/README.databases
"ok, just saw it"
I did tars and zip files yesterday
was looking in the doc dircs
just to make sure setup.py sdist was working
(had to make some minor adjustments to get that working again)
sigh
sigh?
that sdist broke
did you rebuild the html txt docs
no
just testing basic functions
gotcha
"btw, I broke sdist, not you :)"
did the db2 driver from bryan lee get updated
IOW is this the driver from the ibm guy
that was for old system or is it a new one
Bryan Lee is the dude that wrote the db2.py driver
I rewrote a good chunk of it
"ah, gotcha"
these are not the authors of our support but of the driver itself
yes
I thought I should include that to better distinguish the drivers they need to download
maybe I wasn't clear
"btw, you'll have to show me all you do for a release so I can be better help later on"
"ok,"
have all these drivers been tested?
"no, not all"
we may want to add that info to the readme as well
annother plane went down?
yes
heading towards JFK
accident or intentional?
I dunno
cnn.com is down
but the airports in NY are closed
"NEW YORK (AP) - A plane crashed Monday morning in the Queens section of New York, and buildings reportedly were on fire in the neighborhood. "
cnn has next to nothing on it
3 sentences
I think that's cause no one knows anything yet
The Dow index dropped 200 points on hearing the news. 
lol
"paniced, the hurd thunders headlong off a cliff"
:)
"are you adding a blurb to the README about database tests, or should I?"
"I have time, btw"
the only ones I know that work are the postgresql ones
so if you know the others then go ahead
I have to head across campus for a bit anyway
ok
bbiab
back
hey
I'm adding a Platforms Tested: section for each
is that overkill?
nope
i think it's a good idea
good
I'm almost done
jamest: have you tested the pg drivers other than pygresql and pypgsql?
i believe I did at home
that was quite a while ago though
99.9% sure i did
what version if debian potato? 2.2?
testing
"er, woody"
we also need to point out that python 2.x required
i may have added this last week 
damn memory
it's faulty
un friggen believable
"the main login dialog on some of my win98 machines have a box that is , i assume autochecked for ""save password"""
looks like I missed unchecking it last friday
so when I booted the machine up all I had to do was put in my username as the password box was already filled
:)
man this is so wrong in so many ways it's not even funny
"btw, psycopg has ""Copyright 2001 Free Software Foundation"""
are the a gnu project?
sign me up for .NET as MS sure knows security
or did they forget to change the GPL template?
"yeah, tell me about if"
it
dunno
sigh
there's a lot of research in that little file
I hope ppl find it useful
i'm sure people will
"however, there's a lot more time in the code"
 hope ppl find THAT useful :)
lol

hi
hola

como esta?
hi all

"fine, how's the project ?"
pretty good
ToyMan: what is it like in NY this AM?
not much to report on the crash...
i'm upstate
3 deg C and overcast otherwise...;)
brrr
ToyMan: no swimming today eh?
#join gnue
not today.:)
i did go swimming in the Hudson about 2 weeks ago
COLD water
but good..
"momma, no thnaks too cold for me"
ROCK!
rock/
boo
both gfclient and gfdesigner can be packaged 
via mcmillan installer
hey guys
what do you think of XForms W3C standard
?
is it feature filled enough for gfd format?
and they work
which means we're one step closer to setup.exe on windows machiens
anyone hear me?
chillywilly: it may be over filled
am I fscking invisible!?!
hehe
over filled
?
too much jelly in the donut?
;P
"hey cw, how are you"
ok
how are you?
too much complexity for our target application
it is not that complex
imho
"good, but busy"
it is a "better" html forms
just provides like a data model
separates ui from data
all xml
"xforms, we have looked at this"
it looks similar to gnue
you have?
ok
well it is a standard
it didnt really exist when we started
so I figured it would bbe nice to adopt a standard
and BTW its FAR from a standard
instead of creating your own thing
its standard in sense its submitted to a 'standards body'
its not standard in the sense no one is using it
i would be more like to try to adopt mozilla's XUL 
than w3c's xforms
mozilla is implemtneing XForms
chillywilly: hmmmmmmm
hmmm I thought you guys didn't care for XUL?
we can certainly look at it
chillywilly: i like xul
ok
i dont think it fits with what we are doing 
it had 'issues'
but i like it :)
with me its not 'cut and dry'
it never is with you :P
then you couldn't torture the coders as much
"its not either 'i hate it. it sucks' or 'i can like something, but not think its the right something' :)"
must run
bye bye

Hi folks
hey ov
howdy
i guess you are oliver vecernik?
"Zunchst einmal Gre an Reinhard aus Hernstein! Ja, ich bin es."
Hernstein?
Hernstein liegt sdlich von Baden bei Wien.
ah
But lets continue in English.
yep :)
As I wrote in my mail and applying your help everthing seems to work fine.
"heh, the leaked internal M$ memo is funny"
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22770.html
ov: error message is gone?
But... I changed a class in test.gcd. I don't understand how to init this.
init == default values for fields in a class
or init == load new definition for the class?
reinhard: no more error messages.
k
good :)
first of all I'd like to load new definition for a class (update tables).
that is done every time you restart geas-server
ah
in geas.conf there is a line like
# mainlog geas.log
when you uncomment this line you get a log of all db changes
"ok, next question: where can I find a howto for gcd-files? "
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/GNUeModuleGuide/main/x369.html
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/sc.html contains some pointers to good documentation
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ is a more "official" address :)
"yep, after restarting geas, I found my new table. Somewhere in the docs I read, that methods are not yet implemented. Still?"
to be 100% honest
methods are already implemented
but in a way we are not happy with
and we want to redo the implementation
so we don't tell you :)
Grrrr... ;-)
:)
"as I found on the web GEAS, Forms is Alpha stage. A fundamental question:: is there a release plan?"
yes of course
for example forms 0.1.0 is planned for october 2000
umm.....
seriously
forms and reports seems usable
in the state they are now
GEAS was contributed by a company and we are now in the process
of going through the code and adapting it to our needs
"wrt maintainability, performance etc."
"my question was aiming at the release plan, because I consider"
"doing some real work with it, but I'm not sure"
to do so.
What would you recommend?
run
and don't look back
seriously?
i would say
with forms/reports yes
with geas: not yet
sorry
back
forms works
reports is starting to work
geas works but IIRC is slow
realisation should take place Q2 next year. what do you think about?
the forms/geas driver is broken
"okay, 2 tier is my friend. ;-)"
then forms will work for you
we're ready to release a 0.1.0 hopefully today
hammering out the details on a setup.exe install for windows clients
ov: may i ask what kind of company you work for?
I've my own one!
cool
web page?
have a look at http://members.aon.at/vecernik
"I'm dealing in barcode readers, thermal printers and mobile data equipment"
very important is curses support with forms (for my terminals)
does it work now (I read somewhere it was broken)?
it is still broken
however
the 0.1.0 release paves the way for 0.3.0 to start
:-(
which is the UI rewrite release
so I'd expect it functional soon
:-)
on the list of todos for forms
0.1.x - fix current driver issues as found (this includes the geas one)
"0.3.0 - UI rewrite to support curses, web, enhanced UI features, better integration with designer"
is there a possibility to write businessobjects for 2 tier and
port them to geas sometimes?
depends
we're going to try and share trigger/method system
if it works then I think you could at least share the methods
the object definition isn't possible now
I think we also need to share the object system
and the objects need to be data aware
would make forms a little fatter but then forms could play with objects too and they can execute on the client side
or you can go with GEAS
or some configuration like that
actually you shouldn't even have to know that the objects are remote objects or not
imho
just use the GComm object and if it is remote it will take care of loading the ORB and or SOAP or whatever
"I don't know what the GComm object is, but the idea is great! Possible?"
it is just or name for common
GNUe Common package
bbl
ok
quesiont
k
jamest: the question?
about life universe and everything?
lol
wasn't the answer
21?
"jamest: the answer is, ""No"""
argh!
ok
sorry
back
we can now have a setup.exe for forms and designer
however
we should probably come up with a default install behaviour for gnue tools on windows machines
fwiw: gnuef is weighing in at about 4.5MB w/ no other install requirements
we should be compatible with other windows installed programs
most of which I'm certain is wxPython
so we should install 80% of the files under WINDOWS/SYSTEM
rofl
I'll adjust the install scripts immediately
5% under PROGRAM FILES/GNUE SHARED/GNUE COMMON
I guess what I'm asking is what do we want
reinhard: fill up C:\ as well (even if installing on D:)
"gee, this is all great input "
jamest: what d'ya mean?
the target directory?
I'm not sure what you're asking
right now gnuef goes in (default) c:\program files\GNUe Forms Client
and it has an {app}/etc/*.conf
and it has an {app}/shared/images/*.png
in there
designer would work similar
I was wondering if we wanted to do something like
C:\program files\gnue\gnue forms client
C:\program files\gnue\designer
C:\program files\gnue\etc
C:\program files\gnue\shared
"etc, etc"
I vote for the latter
metoo
doesn't MS have some guide lines for this kinda thing?
as do i
"however, we still have issues"
i would even say
s/gnue forms client/forms
so the path is
c:\program files\gnue\forms
ok
standing issues then
  which package contains gnue.conf
:)
common?
is that a package of itself?
"an alternative installation scheme would be to have two installation .exes, a ""GNUe Client Environment"" and a ""GNUe Development Environment"" in which GNUe Client would only contain like gfclient (and grrun when available), whereas the Development environment has all the .exe's"
I'm not saying I'm pushing that
but something to consider
then you don't have conflicting gnue.conf's
"'course, the only problem there is what happens if stuff isn't released concurrently"
sigh
we need a setup mgr app
that can run and update all this crap for us
"(btw, if we stick w/Designer install and Forms install, I'd vote for the conf stuff to go into gfclient"
)
as it's the least common denominator
"jamest: we're not helping much, are we?"
ok
now I've got gnuef in gnue\forms
and a gnue/shared and gnue/etc
however
I need a method of setting the INSTALL_PREFIX and GNUE_CONNECTIONS
unless we make the clients look in some thing like exedir/../etc
as I don't seem to have a way to tell the installer to alter autoexec.bat
sigh
can the setup program run a script or executable as part of the install?
you shouldn't be setting environmental variables for the windows install
jcater: yes
Isomer: it should go in the registry 
precisely
but we don't support that :(
jamest: please don't say that
when in rome....
I want to be able to do a samba install 
jcater: I mean a single entry for gnue pointer
"jcater: yes, that is other bad things"
jamest:??
as it sets we _should_ be able to network install this puppy
registry hacks make than tougher
that's why I don't want to see a registry hack :)
"I think I'd be happy if the client apps (gnuef, designer, reports) looked in their executable is located in"
.....in the dir their .....
hmm
I'd be fine with that if
how does hacking autoexec.bat help network installs?
from there go ../etc/gnue.conf
i doesn't
it
this is my problem
everything is ugly
"it's microsoft, what do you expect? :)"
I'd be fine with that if later on we added an include = line to the config files
(read that LATER ON part :)
"jamest: at least for 0.1.0, I don't think we can do better than looking in the exec dir/../etc"
that's my vote
jcater: any chance I could con you into adding it 
as I leave in about 45 min
and want to get this installer functional
or I can checkin what we have
and you can play w/ it while I add it
:)
nevermind
I'll do it real quick
greetings all
hello
I've been reading the mailing list
seems to be a little progress
some usable implementations and whatnot
um
yip
:)
I think I still have the GNU forms somewhere
I'll sign them and get them in the mail tomorrow
I'd pitch the old ones
"oh, those forms"
?!
ok
hehe
yes... those forms
we can use the help
should I upgrade to python v2?  seems woody uses 1.5.2
woody has python2 deb
and forms will not work with python 1.5.2 anymore
ok
any zope integration by chance?
not that I'm aware of
webware probably
yay
webware is cool :)
"ah, i see"
madlocke been unavailable for awhile?
"yeah.. supposedly he popped in Friday, and should see and hopefully get the code thsi week"
webware?
enlighten me
stbain: webware.sf.net
webware.sf.net ... aims to "replace" zope.. has goals from lessons learned from zope.. AFAIK
"it is quite good, from what i've seen"
python server pages are part of the webware project if I understand correctly
yep
"similar syntax to JSP, it says"
"i dunno JSP, but PSP seems pretty useful"
I've just used php
hrmmm
and perl cgi
so Zope vs. Webware?
well.. if you want.. but most people just choose whatever works for them
no... I meant does anyone know the pros and cons of webware vs. zope?
"webware is still beta, and early in the big scheme of things"
I think they are listed lessons they have learned and goals of webware on the site
zope is too complicated webware fits the brain :)
there maybe a doc on the webware site somewhere that gives pros vs zope
zope is complicated to get up and running with
zope is very powerful though
we use it inhouse
it was a nice surprise to here someone has a somewhat working webware+GNUe code
"('course, at the time, I didn't know about webware)"
zope is complicated to get up and running with?
I found it quite simple to download and install
I had no problem
dtml is a snap
I was generating reports from my Oracle database with dtml in no time at all
I found a doc on workflow written by a python coder.. posted it last night.. www.paul.boddie.net
"(btw I'm not pushing zope over webware; but, I say use the right tool for the right job, whichever that may be)"
exactly
ahhh
"I just found this: ""Zope was the only semi-mature framework I encountered, but it failed me in several areas. I worked with it daily for three weeks before deciding that I couldn't justify enduring its problems. These included..."""
goes on to explain why Zope wasn't the right answer for him
stbain: are you quoting me?

nite all
Mr_You: definitely good point
whats funny is 5 years ago i would have gotten yelled for being up all night
now being up isnt a big deal (its expected) and as long as i do what im supposed to next day im ok
i got in trouble for being NON PRODUCTIVE and staying up
let me paraphrase
five years ago:
'i cant believe you stayed up all night.  how irresponsible'
now:
"'you stayed up all night, get any work done?'"
me: no
"'that was stupid, pretty irresponsible'"
new version of mailman is out
and i wonder where i get the 'who told you that you could stop coding from' :)
Mr_You: sweet
I have a new idea for a band/label.. gonna be sonicalchemy.org ;-)
nice name
"focus will be non-profit company with a philosophy on providing donations to many orgs from the income it brings.. also will focus on featuring individuals with good musicianship, improvisation, and creativity..  not solo acts, but bands, or sitins from musicians for super-group type situation"
I have a new country song...
FSF is one org I'm considering ;-)

hi chillywilly ;)
hi
with zsnes
;)
zsnes.sourceforge.net
didn't I ask you guys to remind me never to ask on #debian questions?
nickr: what happened?
its just a worthless waste of time
"chillywilly: hehe, i been playing with dgen-sdl (sega megadrive emulator)"
because its all newbies arguing about stupid things
anyone here know anything about INN?
nope
"this a a GNUe channel, ask debian questions in #debian ;)"
nickr: #debian is useless plz NEVER ask any questions  :P
organicly grown software is so confusing
chillywilly: thanks
ajmitch: hehe
organicly?
what about inn?
chillywilly: hacked :)
Mr_You: I'm trying to setup a local news gorup heirarchy
"chillywilly: like sendmail and INN, big frankenstein monsters"
rtfm? ;-)
the fine manuals that it comes with are no help
heh
http://www.isc.org/products/INN/
its been so long since I ran inn.. hmm 6+ years
we had the worse news server ever.. big full height 9GB HD on a P100
it just grinded all day and night
semi-full newsfeed
It shouldn't be this hard to setup an exclusively local news system
hehe.. thats debatable ;-)
No it isn't!
there are other solutions.. not sure which... dnews I know
It should be 'these are the gorups I want and how long they live and who can post to them'
nickr: with inn it is ;-)
"I tried cnews, its way more crusty"
you should try bnews :)
back when it was written in shell scripts :)
"I want *less* crusty, not more crusty :)"
"wish I could help, yeah it should't be too hard, inn is just a cluster of weirdness.. use to be anyways.."
hmm
"well the weird thing is that the nnewsgroups I added show up in the list, I just can't read or post to them"
tin reports 'Newsgroup does not exist on this server'
I think you have to set options (maybe another file) that states what is allowed
I was actually slightly afraid of that
because the file I believe you're referring to is freaky
anyone at a windows machine????
"jcater: sure, gnome looks like windows here ;)"
crap... nevermind
(only if it involves GNUe and Windows) ;-)))
I've got a VNC to one
is that enough?
"no, I have access.. but will only admit it in a certain context ;-)"
"Isomer: this is a GNU channel, most ppl use GNU/linux i guess (apart from the rare GNU/Hurd users)"
sigh
I'm sitting at one now
jcater: my condolences
trying to get the installer sorted?
yes
jcater: I'm on a Win2K Laptop from work
what installer?
inno
what is that?
anyone tried the evolution RC1?
"hmm once a fellow i know tried to lube a pineapple and put up his arse, i hear that evolution RC1 gives you same effect with half the mess...."
yes im j/k
geez hehe
I'm looking forward to a M$ Outlook solution for linux.. evolution or mozilla
or the other few
aethena I think
mutt?
wait you might be confusing things
you looking for 'outlook' solution or 'exchange' solution?
evolution enables outlook like features without exchange
which hardly anyone seems to use anyways hehe
but could be useful
um i disagree
evolution isnt even 5% as powerful as exchange services
"IIRC, evolution uses p2p technology to send scheduled events"
and disagree that no one uses the exchange services
the county LIVES off outlook calendaring (shared calendars)
this p2p is probably just via STMP and IMAP and interpreting the email as a calendar event
as well as a few other features
yeah.. thats what I want to use and seems evolution has accomplished that.. last I checked year ago or so I guess
"exchange is CRAP for a mail server, but some of its groupware services are decent (just poorly implemented at times)"
outlook like features
Mr_You: its not on par with exchange services
what other features besides calendar does exchange do? my groups never used them
they might say they have 'implemented' shared calendars but im not seeing it on level of exchange
first off i dont think you can have true shared calendars in p2p mode and be effective
"it works for small numbers with dedicated connections, but after that the updated of the nodes will be delayed and scheduling cant have that"
"It supports peer-to-peer calendaring with users on products that support iCalendar, "
"evolution, that is"
also the key feature used at county by high level officials is 'delegation'
i.e. you can delegate some to read / respond to your email as well as calendars
imap should do that
btw: i think that we (GNUe) will start looking into groupware services
so that you could use your GEAS logic in such things
but thats another discussion
like what kind of application for example?
"btw: last time i was with the ximian folks, their secretaries (nat and miguels)"
used outlook on windows
because evolution couldnt handle delegation at all
and it was too hard to 'train' her to use linux outside of that
and most of the 'investors' used windows
jade and i gave her some SERIOUS SERIOUS SERIOUS crap
I think its possible
since they had to use our bandwidth for a week :)
"we did get like 10 shirts, 5 monkeys, free dinner and some roller coaster rides out of it though :)"
not p2p in the sense of another protocol but p2p using smtp/imap
ie. email apps "messages" will be sent via email and auto parsed and interpreted and deleted.
I think thats how iCalendar works but I dunno
delegation could be done by sending the encrypted imap password to allow switching of identities and/or reading others imap folders
you have an example of a GNUe groupware app?  most orgs seem fine with email/mailing list or newsgroups.. to which any web or desktop interface could provide access too..
tie everything into LDAP
"don't forget workflow, document storage, community calendaring, etc"
"sigh!! well, installed new software on my Win98 station, therefore I must reboot..."
"community calendaring is groupware, but I dunno about document management and workflow.. maybe I'm wrong.. I think of groupware as communication methods"
"definitely GNUe could be useful for community calendaring, workflow, and document management..and many other ERP-type apps"
"I'm even thinking about Content Management System for webcontent from GNUe, but I don't consider that groupware"
CMS sounds sorta like what chillywilly is gonna do :)
"in the end tho, I guess it would be cool to have everything authenticate through GEAS "
he must be keeping it a secret then ;-)
hehe
what comes under the topic of CMS?
really webware could be "everything web" for GNUe..
yes
Mr_You: yes 
that way you could (hopefully) tie in any webware module into GNUe
i (and chillywilly) are going to write a phpnuke-like forum using webware
"given the python-centric nature of GNUe, it seems like cmf.zope.org would fit right in"
i see groupware of gnue integrating nicely into GNUe Workflow and Document Management
"as well as offering shared calendars, contacts etc"
what about phpGroupware?
ajmitch: no comment
ajmitch: "should" only require porting one to webware I guess
wasn't something happening with that & GNUe?
other than i refuse to use a phpMiddleWare with GNUe
"ah, ok"
using webware stuff seems quite useful tho
subsitute i with we as the gnue core team isnt into using phpmiddleware and authentication services :)
:)
"we're already running everything off of python objects, right?"
"ok, I'm gonna be a little upset if I wasted all this time on this debian mirror.. considering its almost 60GBs now"
Mr_You: wow
I should have just hacked at the broken scripts
"ajmitch: thats without source, just debs of US-debian"
tweaking my rsync exclude again
so what are you looking at doing with webware & GNUe? planning to talk to the webware ppl?
um
madlocke already has code working or something
looking to use webware for UI driver for UIhtml.py
ok
that madlocke is working on
forms is designed to abstract UI like it to abstract databases
i.e. you simply provide a UI driver
now the killer thing is if you use something python based you can use all underlying objects
yep
and just reimplement UIdriver.py
i believe madlocke has UIhtml.py and some updates to the objects
that would give us basic functionality for a web version of forms
but madlocke has been AWOL for a little while?
he's back
our agents have tracked him down
hehe
ah ok
only a matter of time before we can extract the code ;)
you've smuggled him back to the GNUe compound for interrogation?
is cvs down?
afternoon jamest
worked for me a little while ago
anoncvs works for me
"problems with a gnu machine, i cant believe that :)"
probably a problem at jamest's end
"jamest: ah, you'rer back"
probably a lsh problem
derek: can you cvs update via your ssh 
key
i.e. pserver always works 
its a SECURE connection that is down most of hte time
jamest: i still pserver
for the gnue box
er gnu
i see
jamest: up for me
mainly cause it took a year for me to get an account that worked for ssh :)
hehe
sigh
i can't update cvs from here
yip
it no longer accepts my key
damn
as since I don't have a password on pserver anymore I'm locked out
ok
upgraded ssh lately?
no
ack
hey chillywilly
subverisons ssh support blows
goats even
anyone play w/ the inno setup stuff?
sigh
yes
that good eh?
inno works great :)
bbl
but the resulting install doesn't
yes it does
it worked fine on my last build
except for the environment vars not being set
hmm
forms worked for me except the environ vars
of course
but designer said critical system dlls were missing
:(
now I'm locked out of cvs
designer was never tested
"but, first things first.. I'm trying to figure out the environ vars"
ever
btw
did you know mcmillan forces the __file__ of our imported stuff to be
located at c:\python21\
fsck!
"no, i didn't see that"
i thought it put everything in dist_gf*
if you do a gfclient.exe -d10
you see all the [mymodule:linenum] Messages
have /python21/gnue/common/something
as the mymodule
I'm trying to see if that's causing it to make the install prefix as c:\python21
sigh
um
that is set in gnue.conf
hardcoded to c:\python21
I changed that for the Inno setup
on my machine
I'm talking about in gfclient.py and gfdesigner.py
so it knows where to find gnue.conf
I'm wondering if that's still basing it off of c:\python21
"well, that's where it initally installs"
at least on my setup
"yeah, but remember, you had me do a fix before you left"
it now uses the base director of gfclient/../etc
oh! I misunderstood the problem
hmm
how goes the windows installer?
"close, i think"
"goes? well, if it was a physical object, I'd have kicked it out the window by now:)"
rofl
"but close, oh so close"
"jamest: btw, I hope you don't mind.. I added to the inno setup file so it'd associate GFD's with gfclient (so you can double-click a form and run it)"
"also, you can right-click a GFD and click ""Edit"" and open it in designer"
cool
i wanted to do that but ran out of time
wtf is inno?
it's the "in" versionn of "mono"
a free installer for windows
takes a script and makes a setup.exe from a bunch of files
with the files we have gnuef and designer are setup.exe's
that install and uninstall nicely
just got to work some kinks out of the system
we can't have that
then everyone will expect easy installs
:P
don't worry chiilly
if the user name contains dan in it
it falls back to a mode that's a royal bitch to install
great!
crap crap crap
we knew you'd like it like that
good work jamest
sigh
when are you doing a setup.sh for *nix? :)
shar style? :)
Isomer: are you volunteering?
Isomer: mcmillan supports a setup file for unix too
jamest: I think we found a volunteer :)
so I'm the worst person to ask :)
dpkg -i gnue-forms.deb
weee
heh
"ok... so if, for example, I have Python2.1 and wxWindows installed... the installer will complete the rest ofthe required tasks for installing GNUe?"
stbain: on windows you require nothing
it's a single setup.exe
"no python, no db drivers, no wxpython, etc, etc"
where is this setup.exe?
"um, we're working on it"
;)
I see
can I help?
it almost works
you may be able to test in a bit
are you running into any specific problems?
"yeah, it don't work"
rofl
hehe
how very descriptive of you
yes... I know how to fix that one
dang
no slapping?
"no, just beating damnit"
what did you do jamest to deserve a beating instead of a slapping?
youg to one too
you got
or is that chillywilly's way of getting kinky?
jcater: i think our working on non-gpl's OS support upsets him
sticks and stones may break my bones
but whips and chains excite me
argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hehe
i can update everywhere but here
yet I didn't change a damn thing on this system
argh!
mcmillan is SO DARN SLOW
yip
or a Athlon 3000Mhz for about the same performance
lol
3000MHz ~= 3GHz
very good
fewl
"chillywilly: dang, those engineering courses worked"
:)
kiss my ass
the new athlon is a 2000+
intel is a 2GHz
:)
jcater: you jealous or something?
"well, I'm really not into that, but I guess you did loan my your trout"
my = me
jcater: keep telling yourself "It's faster than I could do it by hand"
ah crap
why do we let such ppl in here?
jamest: I dunno about that
I could've had it installed on all my win32 machines by now :)
;P
"(if I keep telling myself that, I'll believe it)"
you also like computers
a LOT
chillywilly: why do you complain about ppl like me?
it is called a joke dewd
ajmitch: it's called "jealousy"
get witht he program
hehe
jcater: shutup
you'll make him get a big head
what happened to gdm?
i switched from compiled sources to the debian package :)
oh
sigh
I wodner hoe long this 10MB email is gonna take
ages
who asked you?
gdm has a neat 'login in new window' function which uses Xnest
shut your pie hole or else feel the wrath of the trout
chillywilly: shutup before i smack you in the head with a large (rotten) trout
;P
son of a 
you guys get to have all the fun
not!
shit
this blows
unbelievable
my ssh wasn't falling back to protocol 1 as it's done for friggen even
hmmmm
ever
hmm
protocol 1 is evil
protocol 1 licks my bag
"jamest: ah, i had that problem"
i forgot to set ssh to use protocol 2 by default
damn I think a thread is going to sleep while holding a lock
fack!
doh!
hmmm but that would make no sense
I can't see how it is doing that
assert() is your friend :)
Isomer: or g_assert()
same thing :)
well
same concept anywya

jcater what is iss (inno installer) ?
yes
iss is the inno script file
that generates the setup.exe
hmm
the setup.py files a little dodgy
it needs "-f" on the rm lines
"ok, can fix"
and it asks for my root password even if I'm root
which scares the crap out of me :)
hmm
"Warning.  Using this product may leave brown stains on your office chair."
:)
Isomer: we accept patches :)
"setup.py is,um, a mess"
"Isomer: um, all the setup.py's have -f"
on the rm
jamest is there a way in postgres
to say get the last 10 records 
or something
or do you ahve to get the whole record set
then move the the cursor there/
derek: use limit and order desc
what mdean said
limit
and is it order by
"limit is only in mysql and pgsql AFAIK, tho you can use tricks in others to accomplish the same thing - but not always"
:)
ja - order by field desc
"otay, im not using anything other than postgres so im cool"
select * from foo ORDER BY foo DESC LIMIT 20;
or something eh
yup - something like that
ja it worked :)
arghhh
ever have a some what friend get involved in a 'marketing' deal
and like bug the hell out of you
my wife has a ton of friends that do...
 . mary kay
 . gold canyon candles
 . creative memories scrapbooks
 . pampered chef cooking
heh
jamest: not the one in the root of the CVS?
now those arent too bad as at least they are selling something real
and the girls have fun doing the parties
but we have a couple that we dont even really hang with for a long time
and they are into this financial services deal
it seems like multi level marketing
and they just wont stop
Isomer: fixed it
"we politely say 'not interested really, were too busy'"
etc and they call at least twice a month
would it be rude to say
fuck off?
"'listen dick wads, i dont want jack crap to do with your multi level marketing crap.  go find someother sucker with cash that is stupid enough to part with it on a get rich quick scheme!"""
as im about "  " this far from saying that :)
nah
go fro it
for
"chillywilly: fuck off was my first inclination, but i figured i shoudl use manners :)"
it makes life more interesting
"hmmmm, maybe a trout slap"
yes definitely
they deserve 2 even
"MLM is again't God's will, i'm sure..."
MLM?
nevermind
"multi-level marketing, pyramid schemes, evil money-draining scams ;)"
ya
ajmitch: such as?
"easy use of gdm & Xnest is cool, i can setup my flatmate's gnome setup in a window"
it's listed as 'new login in a nested window' in the system menu of gnome on here
funky!
yep :)
eh?

"mysql is a relational database, without the ""relational"", and looses your data, which leaves ""base"", and we all know that all your base are belong to us!"

hey hey hey
after about a weeks worth of work
I've got gnue working!
woohoo
except it won't connect to our database :)
DB000: gnue.common.GDataObjects.ProviderNotSupportedError: No database driver found for provider type 'pypgsql'
well
thats one better than mysql
it didn't just crash
Isomer: you have the mysql driver?
 jamest: we need to change that mysql error to
"'we are sorry, gnue only works with real databases'"
;)
hehe
jamest: apparently not :)
:)
if anyone hates themselves
we're currently looking for a win32 install maintainer
oooooohhhh ooooooohhhhhh
me me me me me me 
btw: im teasing i dont want the windows install maintenance hell er job
psu: time of KC!
hrmmm
what are you looking for in the way of a win32 install maintainer
?
skillwise
someone who hates themself
and is willing to put up with a world of pain making this shit work
as it's being a bitch
i think once we nail down all the gotchas i'll be cake
but right now I'm sick of it :)
on redhat 7.2 libpq-fe.h is in /usr/lib/pgsql/libpq-fe.h
honestly if someone wants to maintain gnue windows installer
i think they should let us hammer out the errors first
so therefore the #include needs #include <pgsql/libpq-fe.h> or you need -I/usr/include/pgsql
then it should be as simple as making sure they have latest db/ui drivers
and running a bat file
then a inno script
whoooohoo! I got gfdesigner to segfault!
hmmm
chillywilly: could you slap me w/ a trout please
i need to make sure I'm not dreaming
"ok, I'm not dreaming"
darn sticky mouse key
why would you be dreaming?
i have a gnuef setup.exe that works out of the box
at least for postgresql
i need to find all the binary drivers i can
wouldn't it be best to use ODBC connectivity with all of the windows clients?
ODBC is supported
hmm
are boxes not containers?
not at this time
theres no way to resize the labels on the property box?
so there are two rows "foreign_key...."
but I can't see what differentiates them?
"jamest: you will only be able to install stuff like postgresql, mysql, sap-db IIRC"
"I know I tried oracle at work, "
but the oracle drivers require oci.dll
(which IIRC we can't distribute :(
jamest: im willing to test the windows install at work tomorrow
so it rejected the Oracle drivers
do they require it at build time?
or only at run time?
well
I can test them heer
run time
s/heer/here/
BUT
mcmillan rejects them because they fail the import
unless you can manually include them
seemlessly?
bwahahaha
?
talking to yourself again?
you didn't get the =lil= message?
"err, =lilo="
again? how'd you hear me earlier?
:)
"ok, the install works"
w/ some minnor issues to work out
minor?
got some masta work
yip minor
let me commit
when the icon on the desktop is created it doesn't have a form 
so it fails as gnuef always wants a form
we need a very basic "Welsome to gnuef" form that shows some of the features (all non-data bound of course)
that we can attempt to tie to that icon
lol
call it <base>/forms/GFClient.py
"err, call it <base>/forms/GFClient.gfd"
as it looks for that anyway
:)
some inno issues
the working dir isn't set unless to specify it in the iss file
and mcmillan apps assume they're running in the dir they installed to
hmm
so no working dir = failed w/ unable to find ddl files
dll
updates checked in
i didn't touch designer yet :(
jcater: you stable yet?
:)
what is this inno stuff?
and when did we decide to you use it?
derek: the installer program
free windows installer
makes setup.exe
now that I think I understand how to get this program going and doing it's thing
I might do a cvs update :)
it's the only free one I could find
so I used it
and it's nice
very nice
yes it is
I'm gonna switch NCS's stuff to it
gnue now installed into start-programs-gnue
"each app gets an icon, uninstall icon, web link"
jamest: you test double-clicking a GFD?
nope
hang on
does not work
:(
gnuef fails missing dlls
crap crap crap
"DB000:     if self.parser.Parse(buf, 0) != 1:"
DB000: SystemError: Python/compile.c:265: bad argument to internal function
is that fixed?
that's a new one to me
me too
how'd you manage that?
crap
happens when I try and load a form
this sucks
in the designer
anyone know of CVS programs for Win98????
there is wincvs
ssh and samba
or a home server
jamest: I had to boot into Win98 mode to 
test this win install stuff
first time in months :(
that's what wifes pc is for
:)
"well, wx crashes it, remember?"
:(
oh yeah
sigh
I guess I can ssh into work and email a setup.py sdist :(
btw - cvs commited
grabbing now :)
i can't find win32 binaries for interbase on the url given in the file
hmm
still can't parse that file
which file Isomer
"well, any xml file by my guess"
what is the command you're giving (and which platform)
python2 `which gfdesigner` ./helloworld2.gfd
running on rh7
I think the reason is that I've botched the install of PyXML
after looking closer
coz it's occuring inside there
hmmm
i would think that'd work
on thing to remember is that you need to install PyXML under python2.1
"er, 2.x"
"DB000:   File ""/usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/_xmlplus/sax/drivers/drv_pyexpat.py"", line 67, in parseFile"
"DB000:     if self.parser.Parse(buf, 0) != 1:"
DB000: SystemError: Python/compile.c:265: bad argument to internal function
yeah
I know
hmmm
looks like you did 
yeah
sigh
uploading a mysql/pgsql enabled gfclient setup.exe for testing
on 56k modem it'll take a while
whooo hoooo
can you make the beta release
er pre release and put out for us
or is this it?
this is for IRC people with win32 boxes to kick the tires on
"right, thats me :)"
at work anyhow
just i dont have cvs at work
it'll be on my web site
so want to make sure its accessible outside of cvs :)
i'm uploading now
"its my bed time, night night"
nite
7:30?
since when?
:D
nite all
nite
jcater: what's the URL for that setup.exe?
I'd like to kick some tires
jamest's doing it...
hehe
too many j's in here
lol
it'll be
www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release/gnuef-pre-0.1.0.exe
ok
but it'll be a while
n/p
I'll download it tomorrow night
jcater switch opn servers
brb
does that mean that the drive for gnue isn't installed? the drive gnue uses isn't installed? or the driver python uses isn't installed or?
the latter
ah hmm
man my dev box sure is slow
P166MMX I think
"or P150MMX, 133 overclocked"
"DB000:   File ""/usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/__init__.py"", line 58, in dyn_import"
"DB000:     mod = getattr(mod, comp)"
DB000: AttributeError: 'gnue.common.dbdrivers' module has no attribute 'pypgsql'
thats a new error message?
um
what os you running on?
RH7.2
"are you running a copy of CVS, or a download?"
CVS
recently cvs updated
is there a pypgsql directory in /usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/
[perry@saturn gnue]$ ls -d /usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/pypgsql/
./usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/pypgsql/
how did you install?
install which?
using the setup.py in the gnue/ directory?
or the ./setup.py in each tool directory
each one in the tool directory
which version of python are you running?
2.1
ahh
I found out why it says that
the first time I click "Continue" in the wizard
"it says ""no such driver"" (which is false, but never mind)"
the second time it says "has no attribute 'pypgsql'
oh
sigh
so it is a bug
yes
"but uh, not the one that's making this fail"
[perry@saturn gnue-common]$ python2 -c 'import pyPgSQL'
that succeeds
"have you installed mxDateTime, per chance?"
his above import would have failed IIRC
ah ha!
jcater: you're correct
mx was installed for 1.5 not 2.0
just figured that myself
lol
you on a debian box?
nevermind
sigh
nope
rh72 != debian
didn't work on the debian box either :/
oh well
I'm going home
I'll look at it tomorrow morning when I get to work again
thanks for your help :)
(and patience :)
ok
g'night

hi

"btw, why are ou guys calling this abstraction thingy GComm when Dave has a project called GNU Comm (GComm fr short)?"
"as far as I'm concerned, GComm is our internal package name... to the external world, it's GNUe Common"
but that is a good point
jcater: i dont have my python books with me
you know how to make an md5 string from a normal string?
in python?
normally i have a php script to do this but left laptop at home
import md5
m = md5.new(string)
m.digest()
I think
"or, for simplicity, print md5.new(string).digest()  :)"
hmmm
it prints funny stuff though
'\003\340=W@\226%\227\335\260c\026\254)\237\033'
is its output
try .hexdigest()
if you are wanting hex output
argh!
any cvs experts here?
I fscked up
i might be able to help cvs
but .hexdigest() gets errors
hmm
6e53fcfa862e45bf0167068480d403f6
is more type output im looking for
what version of python you using?
sigh 1.5.2
this is a work machine
as I think hexdigest was added 2.0
ok let me try that
BUT from geas/DBdriver.py: 
"    def _make_passkey(self, user, passwd, random):"
        m = md5.new(user + '-' + passwd + '-' + random)
        return self._hexstr(m.digest())
"    def _hexstr(self, s):"
        h = string.hexdigits
        r = ''
        for c in s:
            i = ord(c)
            r = r + h[(i >> 4) & 0xF] + h[i & 0xF]
        return r
you can probably adapt that
how do I delete a friggin directory in cvs?
"I accidentally added __init__.py as a directory, not a file"
:(
"ah pimp slap, 2.0 works just fine (thanks :))"
rm dir
er remove the directory in your local copy
then
remove it in cvs
it wont 'delete' the stupid dir
you have to 'manually' do that
in cvs?
yeah :(
iirc
crap
<sigh>
"dont quote me on that, but i recall some evil like htat"
you must be right
because I keep trying to cvs delete it and it appears to work
also we shoudl fix driver code to use hexdigest
"but when I update or co, it comes back"
I'll do that :)
doesn't jamest have access to the cvs server?
yip
he does
<sigh>
but he's already gone for the day

I need a production quality GNUe web shopping cart ;-)
either that or I customize interchange
so I'd rather work on the former
we there yet?  ;-)
"anything is possible I know, but ideally we need to get ideas on some sort of php and GEAS interface"
guess I'll just customize interchange.. hopefully actually have it done in a few days
lo?  ;-)
Mr_You: howdy
hey
anyone done any documentation or work on a php interface?
um
not to my knowledge
however
I don;t think it'd be too difficult
first you'd need php<->corba mappings
then I'd think you could access GEAS w/o much problem
"well at that point, I need to access inventory, etc.. is that possible?"
I guess anything is possible..
our inventory package isn't completed
but if you have an inventory package
you should be able to access it via geas
IIRC php4 includes a builtin CORBA module
"I need dual functionality, GNUe Forms client and web functions"
"(btw, I'm not a good person to talk w/about geas as I'm not active in that part of the project; I'm just telling you what little I know :)"
are you sold on using PHP?
"not really, but its pretty easy and efficient on resources"
"I know a web interface for GNUe Forms is in the works, but I'm sure you need something relatively quickly"
well
"madlocke was working on that, but as you probably know, he's been out of commission (sick) lately"
my understanding is that it pretty much works
but he got quite ill before we got his code
"that sounds good, I'd love to get my hands on anything in the works"
well
ahh
I do know it is based on 
webware.sourceforge.net
which I was checking out today
(basically Python-based web application services
cool looking
not sure if this was any help or not
well lets hope he gets well 
yes
"my understanding is that he is better, but is currently in moscow"
but hopefully will return home soon
we hope :)
"ok, how soon, you know?"
webware and GNUe might be interesting
well bbl
back hhe
"heh, derek posted a question about memory test speed"
hmm
um
that's an odd question
for us
yeah

hey dneighbo: did you get the latest linux journal?
step by step instructions for converting your access db to postgresql
yip
i dont agree with how they did conversion entirely
but i saw it
"ah good.  I havn't read it yet, just peeked"
any postscript experts here?
real or imagined
jamest :)
"yeah, I know"
"but, alas"

"dude... we will have sent out over 10,000 letters using GNUe Reports mailmerge feature as of this week :)"
it's still kludgy to use
but it's my baby and I'll kludge along with it until it improves

who sings that?
boo
who?
why you crying?
hiya can anyone help with a small gcc query?
we can try
okay cool thanks
though this is about gnu enterprise (a project within gnu) 
ahh okay r u sure you wanna listen? :)
"so if its really complex gcc issue we might not be of much help, but we will surely try :)"
as we do use gcc here :)
it'smore advice i suppose...
okay well RH6.2 compiling openssl with gcc and i get fatal sig 11 errors
not in the same place either
i read somewhere that sig 11 can be caused by bad memory
but i wanted to ask someone if they though reinstalling gcc would solve the problem
any suggestions/comments?
how much memory do you have?
"it's really wierd, by continually trying i can compile but it's driving me mad"
umm 64mb
Try disabling your cache.
"It will be slower, but it frequently the cause of troubles."
"If that solves it, replace it. =)"
disabling it in the BIOS?
yes
"(Sorry, I'm trying to figure out gnus at the same time...)"
ah that could be a problem as the machine is at a hosting centre... (damn)
"best then to compile on a local system and upload it, but I would consider the machine as suspect.  General a memory or cache related sig11 shows up randomly like this."
"One of the things I always do when I buy a new machine is compile the Linux kernel.  If it passes that, then your memory is probably okay.  If not, take it back right away."
hmmm that's what i was thinking
the machine has been in the hosting centre over a year and i wasn't lucky enough to do it's kernel
looks like I'll have to hassle the tech support for some new ram then !
what software is there for testing memory?
what platform?
i386
the very top item on freshmeat right now is a memory tester
hey cool!
nickr: thanks very much!
Sure
I knew compulsively reading freshmeat would payoff someday
it's funny i used to do exactly that... when it was on news://
doesn't it still have a usenet gateway?
unless they brought it back after the fmII update... 
hmm memtest is a standalone app... would need a reboot... darn it... (machine is in hosting centre)
I'm sure theres an in-OS tester
although it strikes me as something that'd be pretty dangerous
yeah i think that's why it's a floppy binary...
cool found one -> http://www.qcc.sk.ca/~charlesc/software/memtester/ doesn't need boot binary... perfect
will probably cause all kinds of havoc
Yes
havoc pennington
?
:)
well it's running... <gulp>
thanks nickr ttfn
where they all going?
F U N W I T H C A P S L O C K O H Y E A H.

chillywilly: 'im having crack urges'
fishdok: trout slaps chilly

"hey mdean, hows the development going?  you expect the new release anytime soon?"
a new release (feature wise) is probably about 3 or 4 weeks away since the db upgrade is going to be huge
I may make an interim bug fix/small feature release to get some of the email support down
"ok, I'm waiting for the new DB version... thanks"

hey derek
hey
galeon rox
why you always be in my bidness?
sheeet
?
galeon is nice
galeon is the cure for the common cold
galeon is konquerer's beotch
"uuuuh, no"
konq has rendering problems still....gecko is konq masta
konq's
chillywilly: when did you last use konq? last year?
doesn't matter KDE is for my grandma or something
"yeah, she's not 1337 enough to use GNOME ;)"
yup
she sucks
i should get my parents using KDE more
i don't think they ever use GNU/Linux
"nah, make them into hackers"
"nah, they prefer to do stuff outside"
gnome reminds me of arthritis
they're gettting close to international selection level for archery :)
jcater: you remind me of an Open Source weenie most of the time but that's besides the point :P
chillywilly: don't make me trout slap you
you cannot for I am the only one who holds the key ti true trout mastery
haha
"ah yes, but this is assuming you can even code your way out of a paper bag"
"i dunno how to code, i am an irc lurker ;)"
although usually I have to code my way outta someone else's crap
at least at work :)
hehe
you ppl are  lame
"well, yeah"
but you do hang out w/us
"oh boy, gotta love those circular dependencies!"
not that much
rofl
only when I have nothing better to do
hey jbailey
I can't believe the ppl they let in here
:P
"sheesh, what's OPN coming to"

how are you doing jeff?
"Good, sleepy though."
"ooooh, you are awake"
Sort of.  I have a habit of doing other work at the same time as IRCing. =)
How are you doing?
ok
"well guys, I'm still recovering from Sunday's move, so I'm gonna call it a night"
nite all

=) Thanks reinhard
"i think registering new projects on savannah is your favourite hobby, isn't it? ;)"
heh - have you been watching my user id? =)
IOW you seem to be quite active in the last days :)
no but i check the "new projects" list every few days
and in like every one that sounds so interesting to me that i have a closer look your name appears :)
=)
mornin all
hiya
howdy
mornin/ guys
hi ToyMan
"reinhard: you arent allowed to look at other projects, no one told you that you could stop coding"
derek: you Access-enabled yet
hi
nope :(
still no stinking monitor
and windows isnt a 'monitorless' operating system
did you try to open it in access 2000?
yes
it wants to 'convert it' (as access 2000 has entirely new architecture)
if i do that it works
"HOWEVER, then i have no way to get back to you"
i.e. verify it all works with your stuff
hmm. just put a copy of xp office on a box
"that's access 2000 , right?"
there is an option to open as access as 97
i was SO excited
until i noticed it made everything readonly :(
shit
heads
2000 and XP dont know how compatiable they are
i assume they are at least same engine so should be relatively compatiable
i will get 97 up here pretty quick
i was hoping i could use the xp box for my access dvlpmnt
ko
what's holding up your monitor?
(besides your desk) ;)
i got email it shipped yesterday
so hopefully will be here by weekend
if i get time tonight i will grab old 14" out of garage and set it up
and get things rolling
we really want to create an action plan
for things
with dates etc
that sounds good
and be much more 'official' than informal help
?
more official?
i.e. accountable
"you mean, like taking it on as a formal project?"
yes
ahhh
i will be back on monday
bye

anyone try msn.com today in mozilla?
the monopoly lives and breathes baby
??
what's it do?
um
try it
:)
in konq or mozilla or galeon
any non ie 5.0 or greater browser in fact
and you will get a lovely
F*** YOU! No MSN for you.
you can get latest version of internet exploder here <link>
seriously give it a try
you might cry
it really is a war
crap
dude!
a suburb here in memphis is basically declaring war on Apple
"man, cygwin is HUGE"
cygwin MUST be trying to sell CDs... why else would cygwin be so much trouble to download/install
rofl
remember this discussion the other day
and i was pretty much told i was an invalid
"well, I guess I join your ranks"
cause i couldnt just cliek setup.exe on cygwin and have it magically work
it's taking me all day to install cygwin
and i was fairly adamant i didnt want us to have ANYTHING rely on it
I'm trying to get the XFree/Win32 port to work
(not make us dependent :)

omg
I just tried w/knoq
I was sure you had to be yanking my chain
i am not
this is really really incredible
in midst of all monolopy stuff
i will say for sure one thing m$ doesnt lack
is balls
really big ones
you got that right
"well, I guess that breaks my msn.com dependency"
shit
heads
?
did I come at a bad time?
:)
refering to MS...
this is like the McCarthy era thing...
jamest: use mozilla or konq
and visit msn.com
the commie committee
(or lynx even)
at some point people will say
are'nt you going just a BIT too far???
hmm
I think we scared gnuebot away
I always wondered if gnuebot and bigbrother secretly fought in the background
heh
hmmm
telling konq to lie about who it is doesn't help either
jamest: what's really interesting is if you try to use Passport
"well, I guess I better go buy about 50 copies of XP"
"it tells you due to ""security concerns"" (you know how proactive MS is :), you cannot use non-MS browsers"
I just put a copy on my wife's computer
lol
it hasn't crashed yet...
ToyMan: ain't it purdy
kinda like playing with my old toys
fisher price kinda
my record for WinME crashing was this
open new computer box
plug in computer
a little fat-happy look
turn on
have it crash while doing initial startup
i just wanna know how to get all the 'reminders' to buy MS stuff off the screen
?
and i notice that after promising not to do the smart tags thing in IE 6...
they went ahead and did it anyway
MS Customer: Why are you sticking that up my butt?
MS: We're not sticking anything up your butt.
MS Customer: Yes you are.  You're standing behind me and I can see you sticking it up my butt.
MS: No.  No we're not.  We promise.
MS Customer: But I can feel it!
"MS: You must have issues.  I mean, if we were sticking something up your butt (which we're not) it'd be for your own good cause we think you're swell."
MS: You misunderstand our intentions.. we are actually pulling something out of your butt.  You should be thanking us.
lol
I'm actually debating on getting rid of my last 5 of my 6 NT machines
either with win2k or kde&linux
the major hangup is of course.....drumroll....Office
or there would be no doubt about going GNU/Linux
"but, james, now is the ideal time to upgrade to XP"
why?
prices will never be this low
:)
what's it running per seat?
I dunno
haven't had the inclination to look
our MS stations will not go past Win98
most are Linux+KDE
ToyMan: now that's not what we mean by "Free Software" :)
the only time that theft seems....sacred
anyone know of the follow type of network drive
I'd like to take all my empty space on client system (lots of huge ide drives w/ little on them)
and create a pool of empty space
that is setup in a raid like fashion
so that data is split across multiple machines
and if a user reboots that machine the data is still available
lol
i just saw the yahoo article on msn.com
they "suggest" other browsers
but I don't see anywhere you can turn if you don't take their "suggestion"
why?
because they overcomplicate our lives
"heh, I think that could be said for a lot of things"
true
mostly computers make things easier though
:P
nah
we just tell ppl that so they'll pay us
it would cost an arm and a leg to develop GNUe without a computer even if only used for communication via IRC
"chillywilly: If you didn't have a computer, would you still care? =)"
yes
argh!!!!!
I strongly dislike cygwin's setup
eh?
what's so bad about cygwin?
um
third time I've had to restart it
(after going for 2-3 hrs)
what sorta connection?
dedicated DSL
why would it take 3 hours over DSL?
it only took 1 hour to install via modem
for me

I still can see new/modified strings every day...

how do you get on the mail list?

I finally got cygwin downloaded :)

hi neilt
hello all
later all
ah ha mdean exists
if exists (select 1 from mdean) print 'hello'
if (mdeam): raise DerekSurprised
mdean : i havent read todo for a bit
BUT we are hitting a wall on something (small wall for now)
-wall?
(small lead wall :)
we are updating 'accounts' 'contacts' to be much more robust and FLEXIBLE
but we are seeing a GREAT value in DCL as a communication tool to customers
as well as a billing tool
and todo tool
yes
the todo tool works fine
so are we
but the communication tool is flawed
if the accounts dont have same products
what tool? ;-)
"I'm working on getting this all together for work, so it is coming"
it should be fairly easy to implement who can view what
by product
but then the next step becomes billing (or services)
example
i have customer
foo with products x and y
and customer 
bar with products a and b
choir ;-)
i want foo to only see stuff for x and y and bar with a and b
BUT the next item is services
say my company does
network installs
programming
support
etc
and bills at different rates for each
i might be working for foo on product x doing db programming sometimes and support other times
at which point products and services need to be 'separate'
i had been cool with only being one and just changing the label
but that was because i didnt see dcl as a communications tool
your use of services sounds like it could be an action
i.e. the customer would never see dcl
mdean: thats very possible
or billing type
or something
"as I said, I am going to be working on this stuff (minus billing) for work, so it will come"
I am going to need to implement RBAC as well
"im throwing out problems, not necessarily demanding they be solved in a particular fashion :)"
mdean: RBAC? really?
chillywilly: yup - better than what's in there now ;-)
we were looking at that too for security in GNUe
if you all would just use phpGW middleware you wouldnt have to worry about security ;)
eh?
why?
im being smartass
"oh, ok"
hehe
subsitute phpGW w/ dotGNU or dotNet or dotDream as you please
screw you man
and on that note I am going to church ;P
